                            Classification of Plants

The newer classification system lists all of the more than 300,000 known plants
in just two phyla, the Bryophytes and the Tracheophytes. Bryophytes, the mosses
and liverworts, are usually soft and nonwoody in structure, take in water throu-
gh short root-like filaments called rhizoids, and may have stems and simple lea-
ves but, unlike the more complex Tracheophytes, do note have true roots or vasc-
ular tissue whose function it is to circulate water, food, and essential minera-
ls throughout the organism.

Tracheophytes are divided into four sub-phyla: lycopsids, which number some 900
living species; sphenopsids, whose fossil species contributed to coal formation
in the Carboniferous period, but which have few living species; psilopsids, an
extinct group of relatively simple plants, which fossil studies show to have be-
en more advanced than any of the mosses; and pterosids, subdivided into three c-
lasses, the ferns, the gymnosperms, and the angiosperms.

The angiosperms, the most highly developed and complex class of plants, reprodu-
ce by means of single and double seed leaves called cotyledons. Monocots, such
as corn, wheat, lilies, and orchids, have leaves with parallel veins, while dic-
ots, which include oaks, maples, roses and thistles, among others, have net-vei-
ned leaves and stems with annual growth rings.

================================================================================

                          Adaptations of Desert Plants

Desert plant populations have evolved sophisticated physiological and behavioral
traits that aid survival in arid conditions. Some send out long, unusually deep
taproots; others utilize shallow but widespread roots, which allow them to abso-
rb large intermittent flows of water. Certain plants protect their access to wa-
ter. The creosote bush produces a potent root toxin which inhibits the growth of
competing root systems. Daytime closure of stomata exemplifies a further genetic
adaptation; guard cells work to minimize daytime water loss, later allowing the
stomata to open when conditions are more favorable to gas exchange with the env-
ironment.

Certain adaptations reflect the principle that a large surface area facilitates
water and gas exchange. Mose plants have small leaves, modified leaves (spines),
or no leaves at all. The main food-producing oragn is not the leaf but the stem,
which is often green and non-woody. Thick, waxy stems and cuticles, seen in suc-
culents such as cacti and agaves, also help conserve water. Spines and thorns
(modified branches) protect against predators and also minimize water loss.

================================================================================

                                     Leaves

Microbiological activity clearly affects the mechanical strength of leaves. Alt-
hough it cannot be denied that with most species the loss of mechanical strength
is the result of both invertebrate feeding and microbiological breakdown, the e-
xample of Fagus sylvatican illustrates loss without any sign of invertebrate at-
tack being evident. Fagus shows little sign of invertebrate attack even after b-
eing exposed for eight months in either lake or stream environment, but results
of the rolling fragmentation experiment show that loss of mechanical strength,
even in this apparently resistant species, is considerable.

Most species appear to exhibit a higher rate of degradation in the stream envir-
onment than in the lake. This is perhaps most clearly shown in the case of Alnu-
s. Examination of the type of destruction suggests that the cause for the great-
er loss of material in the streamprocessed leaves is a combination of both biol-
ogical and mechanical degradation. The leaves exhibit an angular fragmentation,
which is characteristic of mechanical damage, rather than the rounded holes typ-
ical of the attack by large particle feeders. As the leaves become less strong,
the fluid forces acting on the stream nylon cages caused successively greater f-
ragmentation.

Mechanical fragmenation, like biological breakdown, is to some extent influenced
by leaf structure and form. In some leaves with a strong midrib, the lamina bre-
ak up, but the pieces remain attached by means of the midrib. One type of leaf
may break clean while another tears off and is easily destroyed once the tissues
are weakened by microbial attack.

In most species, the mechanical breakdown will take the form of gradual attriti-
on at the margins. If the energy of the environment is sufficiently high, britt-
le species may be broken across the midrib, something that rarely happens with
more pliable leaves. The result of attrition is that, where the areas of the wh-
ole leaves follow a normal distribution, a bimodal distribution is produced, one
peak composed mainly of the fragmented pieces, the other of the larger remains.

To test the theory that a thin leaf has only half the chance of a thick on for
entering the fossil record, all other things being equal, Ferguson (1971) cut d-
iscs of fresh leaves from 11 species of different leaf thickness and rotated th-
em with sand and water in a revolving drum. Each run lasted 100 hours and was r-
epeated three times, but even after this treatment, all species showed little s-
ign of wear. It therefore seems unlikely that leaf thickness alone, without sub-
stantial microbial preconditioning, contributes much to the probability that a
leaf will enter a depositional environment in a recognizable form. The result o-
f experiments with whole fresh leaves show that they are more resistant to frag-
mentation than leaves exposed to microbiological attack. Unless the leaf is exc-
eptionally large of small, leaf size and thickness are not likely to be as crit-
ical in determining the preservation potential of a leaf type as the rate of mi-
crobiological degradation.

================================================================================

                              Plants and Geography

Although different plants have varying environmental requirements because of ph-
ysiological differences, there are certain plant species that are found associa-
ted with relatively extensive geographical areas. The distribution of plants de-
pends upon a number of factors among which are (1) length of daylight and darkn-
ess, (2) temperature means and extremes, (3) length of growing season, and (4)
precipitation amounts, types, and distribution.

Daylight and darkness are the keys by which a plant regulates its cycle. It is
not always obvious how the triggering factor works, but experiments have shown
day length to be a key. A case in point is that many greenhouse plants bloom on-
ly in the spring without being influenced by outside conditions other than ligh-
t. Normally, the plants keyed to daylight and darkness phenomena are restricted
to particular latitudes.

In one way or another, every plant is affected by temperature. Some species are
killed by frost; others require frost and cold conditions to fruit. Orange blos-
soms are killed by frost, but cherry blossoms will develop only if the buds have
been adequately chilled for an appropriate time. Often the accumulation of degr-
ees or the direction of temperatures above or below a specific figure critically
affects plants. Plant distributions are often compared with isotherms to suggest
the temperature limits and ranges for different species. The world's great vege-
tation zones are closely aligned with temperature belts.

Different plant species adjust to seasonal changes in different ways. Some make
the adjustment by retarding growth and arresting vital functions during winter.
This may result in the leaf fall of middle latitude deciduous trees. Other plan-
ts disappear entirely at the end of the growing season and only reappear through
their seeds. These are the annuals, and they form a striking contrast to the pe-
rennials, which live from one season to another.

Precipitation supplies the necessary soil water for plants, which take it in at
the roots. All plants have some limiting moisture stress level beyond which they
must become inactive or die. Drought resistant plants have a variety of defenses
against moisture deficiencies, but hydrophytes, which also are adapted to humid
environments, have hardly any defense against a water shortage.

================================================================================

                                     Whales

Although vocal cords are lacking in cetaceans, phonation is undoubtedly centered
in the larynx.

The toothed whales or odontocetes (sperm whale and porpoises) are much more voc-
iferous than the whalebone whales, or mysticetes. In this country observers have
recorded only occasional sounds from two species of mysticetes (the humpback and
right whale). A Russian cetologist reports hearing sounds from at least five sp-
cies of whalebone whales but gives no details of the circumstances or descripti-
ons of the sounds themselves. Although comparison of the soundproducing apparat-
us in the two whale groups cannot yet be made, it is interesting to note that t-
he auditory centers of the brain are much more highly developed in the odontoce-
tes than in the mysticetes, in fact, to a degree unsurpassed by any other mamma-
lian group.

================================================================================

                           Bioluminescence in the Sea

At night, schools of prey and predators are almost always spectacularly illumin-
ated by the bioluminescence produced by the microscopic and larger plankton. The
reason for the ubiquitous production of light by the microorganisms of the sea
remains obscure, and suggested explanations are controversial. It has been sugg-
ested that light is a kind of inadvertent by-product of life in transparent org-
anisms. It has also been hypothesized that the emission of light on disturbance
is advantageous to the plankton in making the predators of the plankton conspic-
uous to their predators! Unquestionably, it does act this way. Indeed, some fis-
heries base the detection of their prey on the bioluminescence that the fish ex-
cite. It is difficult, however, to defend the thesis that this effect was the d-
irect factor in the original development of bioluminescence, since the effect w-
as of no advantage to the individual microorganism that first developed it. Per-
haps the bioluminescence of a microorganism also discourages attack by light-av-
oiding predators and is of initial survival benefit to the individual. As it th-
en becomes general in the population, the effect of revealing plankton predators
to their predators would also become important.

================================================================================

                                Animal Torpidity

A few species demonstrate conditions which are neither complete hibernation nor
aestivation. Instead of going into a long "sleep" during the most adverse seaso-
n, they become torpid for a few hours each day. This kind of behavior is known
in other animal - bats become torpid during daytime, and hummingbirds at night.
The first time I appreciated this phenomenon was while working with fat mice (S-
teatomys) in Africa. These mice, incidentally, have a most appropriate name, for
their bodies are so full of fat they resemble little furry balls. Fat storage a-
s a method of survival has rebounded to some extent as far as the fat mice are
concerned. They are regarded as a succulent delicacy by many African tribes who
hunt them with great tenactiy; when captured, the mice are skewered and fried in
their own fat. A captive fat mouse was once kept without food or water for thir-
ty-six days; at the end of that time it had lost a third of its weight but appe-
ared quite healthy. During the dry season, some captives spent the day in such a
deep state of torpor that they could be roughly handled without waking. The body
temperature was a couple of degrees above room temperature and the respiration
was most irregular, several short pants being followed by a pause of up to three
minutes. Just before dusk the mice woke up of their own accord and respired nor-
mally. In this case the torpid state was not induced by shortage of food or abn-
ormal temperatures. The forest dormouse of southern Asia and Europe also underg-
oes periods of torpidity during the day; this species has been recorded as havi-
ng pauses of up to seventeen minutes between breaths. There is also a record of
a leaf-eared mouse of the Peruvian desert which became torpid under severe cond-
itions.

================================================================================

                                    Mammals

The history of mammals dates back at least to Triassic time. Development was re-
tarded, however, until the sudden acceleration of evolutional change that occur-
red in the oldest Paleocene. This led in Eocene time to increase in average siz-
e, larger mental capacity, and special adaptations for different modes fo life.
In the Oligocene Epoch, there was further improvement, with appearance of some
new lines and extinction of others.

Miocene and Pliocene time was marked by culmination of several groups and conti-
nued approach toward modern characters. The peak of the career of mammals in va-
riety and average large size was attained in the Miocene.

The adaptation of mammals to almost all possible modes of life parallels that of
the reptiles in Mesozoic time, and except for greater intelligence, the mammals
do not seem to have done much better than corresponding reptilian forms. The bat
is doubtless a better flying animal than the pterosaur, but the dolphin and wha-
le are hardly more fishlike than the ichthyosaur. Many swift-running mammals of
the plains, like the horse and the antelope, must excel any of the dinosaurs. T-
he tyrannosaur was a more ponderous and powerful carnivore than any flesh-eating
mammal, but the lion or tiger is probably a more efficient and dangerous beast
of prey because of a superior brain. The significant point to observe is that d-
ifferent branches of the mammals gradually fitted themselves for all sorts of l-
ife, grazing on the plains and able to run swiftly (horse, deer, bison), living
in rivers and swamps (hippopotamus, beaver), dwelling in trees (sloth, monkey),
digging underground (mole, rodent), feeding on flesh in the forest (tiger) and
on the plain (wolf), swimming in the sea (dolphin, whale, seal), and flying in
the air (bat). Man is able by mechanical means to conquer the physical world and
to adapt himself to almost any set of conditions.

This adaptation produces gradual changes of form and structure. It is biologica-
lly characteristic of the youthful, plastic stage of a group. Early in its care-
er, an animal assemblage seems to possess capacity for change, which, as the un-
it becomes old and fixed, disappears. The generalized types of organisms retain
longest the ability to make adjustments when required, and it is from them that
new, fecund stocks take origin - certainly not from any specialized end product-
s. So, in the mammals, we witness the birth, plastic spread in many directions,
increasing specialization, and in some branches, the extinction, which we have
learned from observation of the geologic record of life is a characteristic of
the evolution of life.

================================================================================

                               Heredity of Horses

Horse owners who plan to breed one or more mares should have a working knowledge
of heredity and know how to care for breeding animals and foals. The number of
mares bred that actually conceive varies from about 40 to 85 percent, with the
average running less than 50 percent. Some mares that do conceive fail to produ-
ce living foals. This means that, on the average, two mares are kept a whole ye-
ar to produce one foal, and even then, some foals are disappointments from the
standpoint of quality.

The gene is the unit that determines heredity. In the body cells of horses there
are many chromosomes. In turn, the chromosomes carry pairs of minute particles,
called genes, which are the basic hereditary material. The nucleus of each body
cell of horse contains 32 pairs of chromosomes, or a total of 64; whereas there
are thousands of pairs of genes.

When a sex cell (a sperm or an egg) is formed, only one chromosome and one gene
of each pair goes into it. Then, when mating and fertilization occur, the 32 si-
ngle chromosomes from the germ cell of each parent unite to form new paires, and
the chromosomes with their genes are again present in duplicate, in the body ce-
lls of the embryo. Thus, with all possible combinations of 32 pairs of chromoso-
mes and the genes that they bear, it is not strange that full sisters (except i-
dentical twins from a single egg split after fertilization) are so different. A-
ctually we can marvel that they bear as much resemblance to each other as they
do.

Because of this situation, the mating of a mare with a fine track record to a s-
tallion that transmits good performance characteristics will not always produce
a foal of a merit equal to its parents. The foal could be markedly poorer than
the parents or, in some cases, it could be better than either parent.

Simple and multiple gene inheritance occurs in horses, as in all animals. In si-
mple gene inheritance, only one pair of genes is involved; thus, a pair of genes
may be responsible for some one specific trait in horse. However, most characte-
ristics, such as speed, are due to many genes; hence, they are called multipleg-
ene characteristics.

For most characteristics, many pairs of genes are involved. for example, growth
rate in foals is affected by (1) appetite and feed consumption, (2) the proport-
ion of the feed eaten that is absorbed, and (3) the use to which the nutrients
are put - whether they are used for growth or fattening, and each in turn is pr-
obably affected by different genes. Because multiple characteristics show all m-
anner of gradation from high to low performance, they are sometimes refeered to
as quantitative traits. Thus, quantitative inheritance refers to the degree to
which a characteristic is inherited. For example, all racehorses can run and all
inherit some ability to run, but it is the degree to which they inherit the abi-
lity that is important.

================================================================================

                            Marine Animal Evolution

Until the 1970's, the pattern of early marine animal evolution seemed to be well
established. Most present-day animal phyla had appeared during the "Cambrian ex-
plosion", an extraordinary burgeoning of multicellular life in the warm seas of
the Cambrian period, between 570 and 500 million years ago. It was assumed that,
despite the very large number of species that appeared during the Cambrian expl-
osion, nearly all fit into the same rather small number of phyla that exist tod-
ay. Each phylum - a group of organisms with the same basic pattern of organizat-
ion, such as the radial symmetry of jellyfish and other coelenterates or the se-
gmented structure of worms and other annelids - was seen as evolutionarily stab-
le. Innumerable individual species have arisen and died out but development and
extinction were assumed to take place within existing phyla; the elimination of
entire phyla was thought to be extremely rare. However, a diverse group of mari-
ne fossils, known collectively as the "Problematica", presented difficulties for
this interpretation. The Problematica show patterns of organization so bizarre
that it is hard to fit any of them into present-day phyla. They include the ban-
ana shaped _Tullimonstrum_ and the spiked spiny _Hallucigenia_, creatures whose
very names reflect the classifier's discomfort. The "Ediacaran fauna", which re-
spired, absorbed nutrients, and eliminated wastes directly through their extern-
al surfaces, are also included among the Problematica. Theirs was an approach t-
aken by only a few modern multicelled creatures (such as tapeworms) that are ot-
herwise totally unlike them. Recently, several theorists have argued that the P-
roblematica are not just hard to classify - they are evidence that the conventi-
onal view of the Cambrian explosion is wrong. They contend that the Cambrian ex-
plosion represented the simultaneous appearance of a much larger number of anim-
al phyla than exists today. Each was a separate "experiment" in basic body desi-
gn, and the Cambrian seas teemed with many different phyla, or basic body plans,
each represented by only a few species. Today, the number of phyla has fallen d-
rastically, but each surviving phylum contains a much larger number of species -
there are at least 20,000 species of fish alone. The Problematica, then, were n-
ot unsuccessful variants within present-day phyla; each represented a distinct
phylum in its own right.

Revisionists and conventional theorists agree that modern marine species are pr-
oducts of natural selection. But the revisionists contend that the selection pr-
ocess eliminated not only particular unfavorable traits, but entire body plans,
entire approaches to survival. The Ediacaran fauna, for example, reprsented a p-
articular structural solution to the basic problems of gas and fluid exchange w-
ith the enviroment. This approach to body engineering was discarded at the same
time as the Ediacaran fauna themselves were wiped out; given the improbability
of duplicating an entire body plan through chance mutation, it was unlikely that
this particular approach would ever be tried again.

                              Saving the Porpoise

Just as the members of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission have subscri-
bed to annual quotas on the tuna harvest, they are agreed that cooperation is e-
ssential in limiting the porpoise kill. The common interest is preservation of
the tuna industry. And since modern fishing methods exploit the cozy relationsh-
ip between the yellowfin tuna and the porpoise, tuna fishing would become less
profitable if the number of porpoises decreased. Tuna and porpoise are often fo-
und together at sea, and the fishermen have learned to cast their nets where th-
ey see the porpoises, using them to locate the tuna. The problem is that many p-
orpoises die in the nets.

The commission deliberations acknowledged the environmental pressures that have
led to strict regulation of U.S. tuna crews under federal law. Delegates also r-
ecognized that porpoise protection goals are relatively meaningless unless cons-
ervation procedures are adopted and followed on an international basis. Commiss-
ion supervision of survey, observer, and research programs won general agreement
at the eight-nation conference.

The method and timetable for implementing the program, however, remain uncertai-
n.

Thus the federal regulation that leaves U.S. crews at a disadvantage in the tun-
a-harvest competition remains a threat to the survival of the tuna fleet. Still,
the commission meetings have focused on the workable solution. All vessels shou-
ld be equipped with the best porpoise-saving gear devised; crews should be trai-
ned and motivated to save the porpoise; a system must be instituted to assure t-
hat rules are enforced. Above all, the response must be international. Porpoise
conservation could well be another element in an envisioned treaty that remains
unhappily elusive at the continuing Law-of-the-Sea Conference.

The tuna industry interest in saving porpoises is bothersome to many who also w-
ant to save the porpoise, but object to the industry motivation for doing so. F-
or fishermen, saving the porpoise is valuable only because the porpoise leads t-
hem to tuna. For more compassionate souls, however, the porpoise is not just a
tuna finder, but, more important, the sea creature that seems most human. Freds-
on Delacourte, national chairman of the "People for Animals" drive, says this:
"It is especially sad that these sea creatures, in spite of their keen intellig-
ence, cannot outwit the tuna fishermen who, anxious to meet their annual quota,
ensnare and destroy porpoises as well. But it is even sadder that the tuna indu-
stry is so intent upon using the porpoise so greedily". Mr. Delacourte praises
the fishing industry for its plans to save the porpoises, at the same time that
he wishes their motives were more altruistic. He insists that any "law of the s-
ea" should be essentially a moral law rather than an economic one.

================================================================================

                                     Reefs

There are a great many points about coral reefs that remain subjects of scienti-
fic puzzlement. One mystery concerns the relationship between Scleractinia, the
coral type whose colonization produces reefs, and their symbiotic partners the
zooxanthellae, the unicellular algae present in the corals' endodermic tissues.
It is known that each symbiont plays an integral part in the formation of a ree-
f's protective limestone foundation. The coral polyps secrete calceous exoskele-
tons which cement themselves into an underlayer of rock, while the algae deposit
still more calcium carbonate, which reacts with sea salt to create an even toug-
her limestone layer. It is also known that, due to the algal photosynthesis, the
reef environment is highly oxygen-saturated, while the similarly high amounts of
carbon dioxide are carried off rapidly. All this accounts for the amazing renew-
ability of coral reefs despite the endless erosion caused by wave activity. How-
ever, the precise maner in which one symbiont stimulates the secretion of calci-
um carbonate by the other remains unclear.

Scientists have also proposed various theories to explain the transformation of
"fringing reefs", those connected above sea level to land masses, into "barrier
reefs" that are separated from shorelines by wide lagoons, and then into free-f-
loating atolls. Though the theory postulated by Charles Darwin is considered at
least partially correct, some scientists today argue that the creation of the r-
eef forms has more to do with the rise of sea level that accompanied the end of
the Ice Age than with the gradual submergence of the volcanic islands to which
the fringing reefs were originally attached. However, recent drillings at Enewe-
tak atoll have uncovered a large underlay of volcanic rock, which suggests that
Darwin's explanation may have been more valid after all.

Even the name giver to the reefs is something of a misnomer. The Scleractinia t-
hemselves generally comprise no more than 10 percent of the biota of the average
reef community: zooxanthellae can account for up to 90 percent of the reef mass,
along with formainifera, annelid worms, and assorted molluscs. Moreover, the co-
nditions under which reef growth occurs are determined by the needs of the alga-
e, not the corals. Reefs can flourish only in shallow, highly saline waters abo-
ve 70 F, because the algae require such circumstances; yet non-reef-building co-
rals - corals which lack the algae presence - occur worldwide under various env-
ironmental conditions, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, home of the red co-
ral prized for jewelry. The most likely reason that the term "coral reefs" pers-
ists is that the brilliant variety of coral shapes and colors makes aesthetic c-
onsiderations more vivid than biological ones.

                              Anopheles Mosquitoes

Following the discovery in 1895 that malaria is carried by Anopheles mosquitoes,
governments around the world set out to eradicate those insect vectors. In Euro-
pe the relation between the malarial agent, protozoan blood parasites of the ge-
nus Plasmodium, and the vector mosquito, Anopheles maculipennis, seemed at first
inconsistent. In some localities, the mosquito was abundant but malaria rare or
absent, while in others the reverse was true. In 1934 the problem was solved. E-
ntomologists discovered that A. maculipennis is not a single species but a group
of at least seven.

In outward appearance the adult mosquitoes seem almost identical, but in fact t-
hey are marked by a host of distinctive biological traits, some of which prevent
them from hybridizing. Some of the species distinguished by these traits were f-
ound to feed on human blood and thus to carry the malarial parasites. Once iden-
tified, the dangerous members of the A. maculipennis complex could be targeted
and eradicated.

                      The Antibacterial Property of Honey

An ancient use for honey was in medicine as a dressing for wounds and inflammat-
ions. Today, medicinal uses of honey are largely confined to folk medicine. On
the other hand, since milk can be a carrier of some diseases, it was once thoug-
ht that honey might likewise be such a carrier. Some years ago this idea was ex-
amined by adding nine common pathogenic bacteria to honey. All the bacteria died
within a few hours or days. Honey is not a suitable medium for bacteria for two
reasons - it is fairly acid and it is too high in sugar content for growth to o-
ccur. This killing of bacteria by high sugar content is called osmotic effect.
It seems to function by literally drying out the bacteria. Some bacteria, howev-
er, can survive in the resting spore form, though not grown in honey.

Another type of antibacterial property of honey is that due to inhibine. The pr-
esence of an antibacterial activity in honey was first reported about 1940 and
confirmed in several laboratories. Since then, several papers were published on
this subject. Generally, most investigators agree that inhibine (name used by D-
old, its discoverer, for antibacterial activity) is sensitive to heat and light.
The effect of heat on the inhibine content of honey was studied by several inve-
stigators apparently, heating honey sufficiently to reduce markedly or to destr-
oy its inhibine activity would deny it a market as first-quality honey in sever-
al European countries. The use of sucrose and inhibine assays together was prop-
osed to determine the heating history of commercial honey.

Until 1963, when White showed that the inhibine effect was due to hydrogen pero-
xide produced and accumulated in diluted honey, its identity remained unknown.
This material, well known for its antiseptic properties, is a byproduct of the
formation fo gluconic acid by an enzyme that occurs in honey, glucose oxidase.
The peroxide can inhibit the growth of certain bacteria in the diluted honey. S-
ince it is destroyed by other honey constituents, and equilibrium level of pero-
xides occur in a diluted honey, its magnitude depending on many factors such as
enzyme activity, oxygen availability, and amounts of peroxide-destroying materi-
als in the honey. The amount of inhibine (peroxide accumulation) in honey depen-
ds on floral type, age, and heating.

A chemical assay method has been developed that rapidly measures peroxide accum-
ulation in diluted honey. By this procedure, different honeys have been found to
vary widely in the sensitivity of their inhibine to heat. In general, the sensi-
tivity is about the same as or greater than that of invertase and diastase in h-
oney.

================================================================================

                                    Termites

It is well known that termites are blind, but little has been discovered about
the other sense organs of these insects or their reactions to various stimuli.
Body odors, as well as odors related to sex and to colony, certainly play a part
in the activities of the termite colony. When specimens of eastern subterranean
termites are placed in a jar containing a colony of rotten wood termites from t-
he pacific Coast, the host termites recognize these foreign insects by differen-
ces in odor and eventually kill the invaders. The progress of the chase and kill
is very slow, and the larger host termites appear awkward in their efforts to b-
ite and kill their smaller but quicker-moving cousin. Finally, more or less by
sheer numbers and by accident, they corner and exterminate the enemy.

Eastern dealated (wingless) termites that manage to survive in the rotten wood
termite colony for more than a week, however, are no longer molested. This is n-
oteworthy, since eastern termites of this variety had previously been pursued a-
nd killed. Fresh eastern wingless specimens placed in the colony alongside the
week-old visitors are immediately attacked, thus indicating that the rotten wood
termites have in no way lost their capacity for belligerence.

What else besides odor helps termites interpret the world around them? The inse-
cts have sense of "chorodontal" organs located on the antennae, on the bristles,
on the base of the mandibles, and on the legs. These organs apparently enable t-
ermites to receive vibrations sent through the air, or, more precisely, aid in
the reception of stimuli sent through the nest material or through air pockets
within the nest material. When alarmed, soldier termites exhibit synchronous, c-
onvulsive movements that appear to be a method of communication adapted to the
chorodontal organ system, although no sound that is audible to man is produced
by these movements. Termite soldiers also strike their heads against wood and o-
ther nest materials, producing noises that, after passing through the sounding
board formed by the nest material, become rustling and crackling sounds plainly
audible to man's duller and possibly differently attuned perceptions. In fact,
soldiers of one termite species, found in the arid regions of California, strike
their heads against the dry, dead flower stalks of Spanish bayonets and agave p-
lants with such force that the sound produced can be heard several feet away. O-
ther types of soldier termites found in the tropics make audible clicking noises
with their jaws.

There is a clear correlation between the functioning of the chorodontal system
and termite settlement patterns. Seldom are termites found infesting railroad t-
ies over which there is frequent heavy traffic, or on the woodwork of mill or f-
actory buildings where heavy machinery in motion would cause vibrations. Small 
scale tests with a radio speaker and vibrator yielded interesting results when
termites were placed in the speaker and exposed to various frequency vibration.
When the vibrations ranged from 50-100 per second, the termites were thrown abo-
ut; at vibrations of 100-500, termites set their feet and mandibles and held on
with all their power; at 2,000-5,000 vibrations per second, the termites crawled
about undisturbed.

================================================================================

                                  Insecticides

Traditional strategies for controlling insect-pests tend to rely on the use of
nonselective insecticides that cause extensive ecological disruption. The alter-
native sterile-insect technique, in which members of the target species are irr-
adiated to cause sterility, has enjoyed some modest success. When released into
an infested area, the sterile insects mate with normal insects but produce no o-
ffspring. Unfortunately, the irradiation weakens the insects, making it less li-
kely that they will mate; and, in any event, sterile insects do not search sele-
ctively for non-sterile mates. A third, newly developed strategy is based on pa-
rasite release.

Pest hosts and their associated parasites have evolved biological and behavioral
characteristics that virtually ensure that the relative numbers of hosts and pa-
rasites in the ecosystem they inhabit remain within relatively narrow limits -
even though coexisting populations may fluctuate up to 100-fold during a single
season. The close numerical relationships are entirely consistent with nature's
balancing mechanisms, which permit closely associated organisms to live together
in harmony. Thus, in natural populations, the ratios of parasites to hosts are
not high enough to result in dependable control. However, it is possible to mass
-rear parasites so that they can be released at strategic times and in numbers
that result in parasite-to-host ratios sufficient to control host populations.

_Biosteres tryoni_, for example, has a strong affinity for medfly larvae. Let u-
s assume that a new medfly infestation is descovered. It is likely to have orig-
inated from a single female and, even in an area with a good surveillance progr-
am, to be in the third reproductive cycle. The rate of population increase is 10
-fold per generation; so at the time the infestation comes to light, about 1,000
males and 1,000 females are emerging and will produce a total of approximately
80,000 larvae. Reproduction will be concentrated in an area of about one square
mile, but scattered reproduction will occur anywhere within a 25-square mile ar-
ea. At first glance, the odds of controlling the infestation by parasite release
seem low; but with new techniques for mass-producting parasites, it is possible
to release one million males and one million females into the infested area. Th-
is would mean an average of 62 females per acre, and the average female parasit-
izes about 30 host larvae during its lifetime. Additionally, the parasites acti-
vily search for host habitats by using the kairomone signals emanating from inf-
ested fruit. Even assuming that only 10 percent of the released females are suc-
cessful and further that they parasitize an average of only 10 larvae, they cou-
ld still parasitize one million larvae. Only 80,000 larvae are available, howev-
er, so the actual ratio would be 12.5:1. A ratio as low as 5:1 results in 99 pe-
rcent parasitism.

This method of pest eradication presents no health or environmental problems and
is actually cheaper. The cost of mass-rearing and distributing B. tryoni is abo-
ut $ 2,000 per million. So even if six million parasites of both sexes are rele-
ased during a period corresponding to three medfly reproductive cycles, the tot-
al cost of the treatment would be $ 12,000 - compared to $ 25,000 for a single
insecticide spray application to the same 25-square mile area.

================================================================================

                              Adaptive Divergence

Both plants and animals of many sorts show remarkable changes in form, structur-
e, growth habits, and even mode of reproduction in becoming adapted to different
climatic environment, types of food supply, or mode of living. The divergence in
response to evolution is commonly expressed by altering the form and function of
some part or parts of the organism, the original identity of which is clearly d-
iscernible. For example, the creeping foot of the snail is seen related marine
pteropods to be modified into a flapping organ useful for swimming, and is chan-
ged into prehensile arms that bear suctorial disks in the squids and other ceph-
alopods. The limbs of various mammals are modified accordign to several differe-
nt modes of life - for swift running (cursorial) as in the horse and antelope,
for swinging in trees (arboreal) as in the monkeys, for digging (fossorial) as
in the seals, whales and dolphins, and for other adaptations. The structures or
organs that show main change in connection with this adaptive divergence are co-
mmonly identified readily as homologous, in spite of great alterations. Thus, t-
he finger and wristbones of a bat and whale, for instance, have virtually nothi-
ng in common except that are definitely equivalent elements of the mammalian li-
mb.

================================================================================

                              Adaptive Convergence

The opposite of adaptive divergence is an interesting and fairly common express-
ion of evolution. Whereas related groups of organisms take on widely different
characters in becoming adapted to unlike environments in the case of adaptive d-
ivergence, we find that unrelated groups of organisms exhibit adaptive converge-
nce when they adopt similar modes of life or become suited for special sorts of
environments. For example, invertebrate marine animals living firmly attached to
the sea bottom or to some foreign object tend to develop a subcylindrical or co-
nical form. This is illustrated by coral individuals, by many sponges, and even
by the diminutive tubes of bryozoans. Adaptive convergence in taking this coral-
like form is shown by some brachiopods and pelecypods that grew in fixed positi-
on. More readily appreciated is the streamlined fitness of most fishes for movi-
ng swiftly through water; they have no neck, the contour of the body is smoothly
curved so as to give minimum resistance, and the chief propelling organ is a po-
werful tail fin. The fact that some fossil reptiles (ichthyosarus) and modern m-
ammals (whales, dolphins) are wholly fishlike in form is an expression of adapt-
ive convergence, for these air-breathing reptiles and mammals, which are highly
efficient swimmers, are not closely related to fishes. Unrelated or distantly r-
elated oragnisms that develop similarity of form are sometimes designated as ho-
meomorphs (havign the same form).

================================================================================

                               Endangered Species

All along the chain of biological evolution, the extinction of species appears
to have been a stage in the process of adapting genetic lineages to changing en-
vironmental conditions. Although some catastrophic extinction occurred naturall-
y, producing total loss of a genetic line, such catastrophes were comparatively
rare. In modern times, however, human activities have altered the fundamental n-
ature of this process, resulting in nearly total genetic losses.

It is difficult to gain general agreement that man-induced increases in the end-
angerment and extinction of wildlife - whether due to habitat alteration or los-
s, pollution, insufficiently regulated hunting, or other factors - are undesira-
ble. It is, however, more difficult to obtain consensus when consideration is g-
iven to the economic costs of correcting such trends, including natural habitat
preservation, regulation of pesticides and other toxic substances, and wildlife
and park management. Endangered species often are, in effect, competitors with
humans for habitat and other resources which also provide other kinds of human
uses and needs.

Measures needed to protect endangered species vary considerably in difficulty a-
nd cost. Of the approximately 400 invertebrate species which at present appear
to be threatened, for example, about one-third could probably be restored by su-
ch inexpensive means as modifying the boundaries of designated natural areas, a-
cquiring and protecting caves and other small areas which contain the particular
species, and additional management of parks and refuges.

Another one-third of the endangered lower animal species are threatened princip-
ally by water pollution and could be protected by improved control, particularly
of five southern rivers. The remaining one-third of the 400 endangered shellfish
species would be considerably more difficult to protect. These are threatened by
complex factors, such as the Asian snail, dredging, quarry washing, poor erosion
control, and lowering of water tables.

The indentification of threatened species and other significant wildlife trends
must precede any corrective measures, and our knowledge base for making such id-
entification is deficient in many respects. Our present lists of threatened spe-
cies and subspecies are known to be incomplete, except in those geographical ar-
eas which contain habitats of species that have important commercial or sports
harvest value.

================================================================================

                         Objections to Darwin's Theory

After a major theory has become doctrine, we tend to froget seemingly legitimate
objections later shown to be incorrect, remembering only the controversial aspe-
cts of those theories. This leads to retrospective arrogance: by aligning ourse-
lves with the victorious doctrine, we disdain those who opposed it.

Although much has been written about the theological conflicts with Darwinian t-
heory, little is known of the powerful scientific objections that modified Darw-
in's beliefs.

During Darwin's lifetime, the accepted theory of heredity was that of blending
inheritance, in which forms intermediate between those of the parents resulted
from mating. Mendel's discovery that inheritance was particulate was published,
but was unrecognized. Jerkin pointed out that if a rare and favorable mutation
occurred, it would soon be obliterated due to "swamping" from repeated crossings
from the wild-type form. Disputing Darwin's conception of evolution as proceedi-
ng through the natural selection of those with slightly better characteristics
than arose randomly, Jerkin concluded that natural selection could not account
for the tremendous diversity of life, hypothesizing that large numbers of organ-
isms mutated simultaneously in the same direction - a controlled orthogenetic p-
rocess resembling a series of "special creations".

Since "special creationism" was an ideological target of Darwin's, he found him-
self in a quandary. Although he did not abandon his theory, he admitted that na-
tural selecion played a much smaler part in evolution than he had previously cl-
aimed. He also embraced the Lamarckian concept that somatic changes in parents
are transmitted to their offspring, thus providing a mechanism by which an enti-
re population could change in the same direction at once.

Another potent objection came from the physicists led by Lord Kelvin, who conte-
sted the assumption of previous geologists and biologists that life had existed
for billions of years, if not infinitely. How, these iconoclasts questioned, co-
uld evolution proceed by slow steps in millions of years, and how could advanced
forms, recently evolved, show such great differences? The Kelvinists, basing th-
eir conclusions on the assumption that the sun was an incandescent liquid mass
rapidly radiating heat, calculated that the age of the earth was between twenty
and forty million year.

Darwin was forced to admit that their calculations were correct and their premi-
ses rational, and to adjust his theory, he proposed that change had occurred mu-
ch more rapidly in the past than in the present, where species seemed static, a-
nd that more advanced forms varied more rapidly than lower forms. This provided
further reason to advocate Lamarck's theory of inheritance, because that could
account for the rapid change.

It is interesting to note that both these retreats of Darwin were later shown to
be faulty. The discovery that the sun runs on a nearly infinite amount of atomic
fuel totally invalidated Kelvin's argument. Mendel was "rediscovered" in the tw-
entieth century, when it was pointed out that the particulate nature of inherit-
ance meant that favorable mutation could not only persist, but could rapidly be-
come prevalent.

================================================================================

                                Darwinian Theory

Yet, while Darwinian theory extends its domain, some of its cherished postulates
are slipping, or at least losing their generality. The "modern synthesis", the
contemporary version of Darwinism that has reigned for thirty years, took the m-
odel of adaptive gene substitution within local populations as an adequate acco-
unt, by accumulation and extension, of life's entire history. The model may wor-
k well in its empirical domain of minor, local, adaptive adjustment; population-
s of the moth _Biston betularia_ did turn black, by substitution of a single ge-
ne, as a selected response for decreased visibility on trees that had been blac-
kened by industrial soot. But is the origin of a new species simply this process
extended to more genes and greater effect? Are larger evolutionary trends within
major lineages just a further accumulation of sequential adaptive changes?

Many evolutionists (myself included) are beginning to challenge this synthesis
and to assert the hierarchical view that different levels of evolutionary change
often reflect different kinds of causes. Minor adjustment within populations may
be sequential and adaptive. But speciation occur by major chromosomal changes t-
hat establish sterility with other species for reasons unrelated to adaptation.
Evolutionary trends may represent a kind of higher-level selection upon essenti-
ally static species themselves, not the slow and steady alteration of a single
large population through untold ages.

Before the modern synthesis, many biologists (see Bateson, 1922, in bibliograph-
y) expressed confusion and depression because the proposed mechanisms of evolut-
ion at different levels seemed contradictory enough to preclude a unified scien-
ce. After the modern synthesis, the notion spread (amounting alost to a dogma a-
mong its less thoughtful lieutenants) that all evolution could be reduced to the
basic Darwinism of gradual, adaptive change within local populations. I think t-
hat we are now pursuing a fruitful path between the anarchy of Bateson's day and
the restriction of view imposed by the modern synthesis. The modern synthesis w-
orks in its appropriate arena, but the same Darwinian processes of mutation and
selection may operate in strikingly different ways at higher domains in a hiera-
rchy of evolutionary levels. I think that we may hope for uniformity of causal
agents, hence a single, general theory with a Darwinian core. But we must reckon
with a multiplicity of mechanisms that preclude the explanation of higher level
phenomena by the model of adaptive gene substitution favored for the lowest lev-
el.

At the basis of all this ferment lies nature's irreducible complesxity. Organis-
ms are not billiard balls, propelled by simple and measurable external forces to
predictable new positions on life's pool table. Sufficiently complex systems ha-
ve greater richness. Organisms have a history that constrains their future in m-
yriad, subtle ways. Their complexity of form entails a host of functions incide-
ntal to whatever pressures of natural selection superintended the initial const-
ruction. Their intricate and largely unknown pathways of embryonic development
guarantee that simple inputs (minor changes in timing, for example) may be tran-
slated into marked and surprising changes in output (the adult organism).

Charles Darwin chose to close his great book with a striking comparison that ex-
presses this richness. He contrasted the simpler system of planetary motion, and
its result of endless, static cycling, with the complexity of life and its wond-
rous and unpredictable change through the ages.

There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been or-
iginally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has
gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginni-
ng endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, ev-
olved.

================================================================================

                               Genetic Variation

Genetic variation is also important in the evolution of lower organisms such as
bacteria, and here too it arises from mutations. Bacteria have only on chromoso-
me, however, so that different alleles or variant forms of a gene are not norma-
lly present within a single cell. The reshuffling of bacterial genes therefore
ordinarily requires the introduction into a bacterium of DNA carrying an allele
that originated in a different cell. One mechanism accomplishing this interbact-
erial transfer of genes in nature is transduction: certain viruses that can inf-
ect bacterial cells pick up fragments of the bacterial DNA and carry the DNA to
other cells in te course of a later infection. In another process, known as tra-
nsformation, DNA released by cell death or other natural processes simply enters
a new cell from the environment by penetration the cell wall and membrane. A th-
ird mechanism, conjugation, involves certain of the self-replicating circular s-
egments of DNA called plasmids, which can be transferred between bacterial cells
that are in direct physical contact with each other.

Whether the genetic information is introduced into a bacterial cell by transduc-
tion, transformation or conjugation, it must be incorporated into the new host's
hereditary apparatus if it is to be propagated as part of that apparatus when t-
he cell divides. As in the case of higher organisms, this incorproation is ordi-
narily accomplished by the exchange of homologous DNA; the entering gene must h-
ave an allelic counterpart in the recipient DNA. Because homologous recombinati-
on requires overall similarity of the two DNA segments, it can take place only
between structually and ancestrally related segments. And so, in bacteria as we-
ll as in higher organisms, the generation of genetic variability is limited to
what can be attained by exchanges between different alleles of the same genes or
between different genes that have stretches of similar nucleotide sequences. Th-
is requirement imposes severe constraints on the rate of evolution that can be
attained through homologous recombination.

Until recently mutation and homologous recombination nevertheless appeared to be
the only important mechanisms for generating biological diversity. They seemed
to be able to account for the degree of diversity observed in most species, and
the implicit constraints of homologous recombination - which prevent the exchan-
ge of genetic information between unrelated organisms lacking extensive DNA-seq-
uence similarity - appeared to be consistent with both a modest rate of biologi-
cal evolution and the persistence of distinct species that retain their basic i-
dentity generation after generation.

Within the past decade or so, however, it has become increasingly apparent that
there are various "illegitimate" recombinational processes, which can join toge-
ther DNA segments having little or no nucleotide-sequence homology, and that su-
ch processes play a significant role in the organization of genetic information
and the regulation of its expression. Such recombination is often effected by t-
ransposable genetic elements: structurally and genetically discrete segments of
DNA that have the ability to move around the chromosomes and the extrachromosom-
al DNA molecules or bacteria and higher organisms. Although transposable elemen-
ts have been studied largely in bacteria cells, they were originally discovered
in plants and are now known to exist in animals as well. Because illegitimate r-
ecombiantion can join together DNA segments that have little, if any, ancestral
relationship, it can affect evolution in quantum leaps as well as in small step-
s.

================================================================================

                               Why Organisms Age

The reasons organisms age have bee much discussed. Some have claimed that senes-
cence is a mechanism for culling the aged from the population to prevent overcr-
owding. Others have believed aging to be the unavoidable outcome of tissue meta-
bolism. Still others have felt the question of senescence to be largely irrelev-
ant since few wild organisms ever reach the senile state. Modern evolutionary t-
heory has a rationale for senescence which has a firm theoretical base: natural
selection of individuals.

One should be skeptical of the claim that oragnisms deteriorate with age as an
inevitable outcome of living. Considering the complex morphogenetic changes many
organisms undergo during development, it would seem that maintaining what has b-
een formed should be relatively simple. A valid theory of senescence must expla-
in why salmon usually deteriorate rapidly and die after spawning, at an age of
two or three, while trees and tortoises may live for hundreds of years without
degeneration.

Senescence, in and of itself, can never help the individual's Darwinian fitness.
All else being equal, an organism's chances of perpetuating its genes are better
if it is healthy rather than sick, alive rather than dead. If senescence is to
be compatible with natural selection, there must be some concomitant benefit as-
sociated with it that outweighs its disadvantage. Since Darwinian fitness is me-
asured by total reproduction, the advantage must be that senescnce is inextrica-
bly tied up with reproductive effort.

Consider that all organisms have a finite probability of dying of natural causes
within any given time period. This puts a premium on reproducing sooner rather
than later. In other words, an oragnism's Darwinian fitness tends to be enhanced
by not deferring reproduction till a later time, for that organism might be kil-
led or injured in the interim. The degree of risk of an organism is subject to
determines how much pressure there is to reproduce soon.

An insect, for example, may have a ten percent chance of being killed each day;
it is not surprising that insects have high reproductive rates, and high rates
of senescence. Tortoises, on the other hand, have heavy shells which presumably
provide efficient protection against predation and injury; because their mortal-
ity risk is low, they are able to rely on long lives and can defer reproduction
until times are are most favorable. Their senescence rates are low.

If an organism is able to have more offspring as it ages, it experiences an evo-
lutionary pressure opposing that caused by mortality. In such cases, low senesc-
ence rates are favored to take advantage of the increased reproductive rate at
future times. This theory would predict that female fish which produce more eggs
as they grow older and larger would age at a much slower rate than male fish wh-
ose sperm production does not rise with size.

This line of reasoning suggests that when oragnisms have little or no chance of
reproducing, they tend to die early as a result of physical degenerative changes
called senescence. But how, then, does this hypothesis explain the continued su-
rvival of humans well past reproductive age? Why do human females live long liv-
es after menopause has marked the end of their ability to bear further offsprin-
g? There are at least two explanations. One is that this situation is an evolut-
ionary anomaly: primitive people rarely lived past fifty. But a more complete e-
xplanation is that postreproductive people can advance their reproductive fitne-
ss through parental and grandparental care of their descendants: by furnishing
advice, food, protection, a place in society, among other things, they can grea-
tly advance the furture reproduction of their already existing descendants.

================================================================================

                                 Photosynthesis

Studies of photosynthesis began in the late eighteenth century. One scientist f-
ound that green plants produce a substance (later shown to be oxygen) that supp-
orts the flame of a candle in a closed container. Several years later it was di-
scovered that a plant must be exposed to light in order to replenish this flame-
sustaining "substance". Soon another discovery showed that the oxygen is formed
at the expense of another gas, carbon dioxide.

In 1804, De Saussure conducted experiments revealing that equal volumes of carb-
on dioxide and oxygen are exchanged between a plant and the air surrounding it.
De Saussure determined that the weight gained by a plant grown in a pot equals
the sum of the weights of carbon derived from absorbed carbon dioxide and water
absorbed through plant roots. Using this information, De Saussure was able to p-
ostulate photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water combine using energy in the fo-
rm of light to produce carbohydrates, water, and free oxygen. Much later, in 18-
45, scientists' increased undrestanding of concepts of chemical energy led them
to perceive that, through photosynthesis, light energy is transformed and stored
as chemical energy.

In the twentieth century, studies comparing photosynthesis in green plants and
in certain sulfur bacteria yielded important information about the photosynthet-
ic process. Because water is both a reactant and a product in the central react-
ion, it had long been assumed that the oxygen released by photosynthesis comes
from splitting the carbon dioxide molecule. In the 1930's, however, this popular
view was decisively altered by the studies of C.B.Van Niel. Van Niel studied su-
lfur bacteria, which use hydrogen sulfide for photosynthesis in the same way th-
at green plants use water, and produce sulfur instead of oxygen. Van Niel saw t-
hat the use of carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates was similar in the two types
of organisms. He reasoned that the oxygen produced by green plants must derive
from water - rather than carbon dioxide, as previously assumed - in the same way
that the sulfur produced by the bacteria derives from hydrogen sulfide. Van Nie-
l's finding was important because the earlier belief had been that oxygen was s-
plit off from carbon dioxide, and that carbon then combined with water to form
carbohydrates. The new postulate was that, with green plants, hydrogen is remov-
ed from water and then combines with carbon dioxide to form the carbohydrates n-
eeded by the organism.

Later, Van Niel's assertions were strongly backed by scientists who used water
marked with a radioactive isotope of oxygen in order to follow photosynthetic r-
eactions. When the photosynthetically produced free oxygen was analyzed, the is-
otope was found to be present.

================================================================================

                            Genetics and Inheritance

Although genetics is all about inheritance, inheritance is certainly not all ab-
out genetics. Nearly all inherited characters more complicated than a single ch-
ange in the DNA involve gene and environment acting together. It is impossible
to sort them into convenient compartments. An attribute such as intelligence is
often seen as a cake which can be sliced into so much "gene" and so much "envir-
onment". In fact, the two are so closely blended that trying to separate them is
more like trying to unbake the cake. Failure to understand this simple biologic-
al fact leads to confusion and worse.

Not far from Herbert Spencer's (and his neighbor Karl Marx's) tomb, in Hampstead
- a notably affluent part of London - is a large red-brick house. It was occupi-
ed by Sigmund Freud after he fled Austria to avoid racial policies which descen-
ded from the Galtonian ideal. On his desk is a collection of stone axes and anc-
ient figurines. Freud's interest in these lay in his belief that behavior is co-
ntrolled by biological history.

Everyone, he thought, recapitulates during childhood the phases which humans ex-
perienced during evolution. Freud saw unhappinss as a sort of living fossil, the
emergence of ancient behavior which was inappropriate today. Like Galton he vie-
wed the human condition as formed by inheritance. The libido and ego are, he wr-
ote, "at bottom heritages, abbreviated recapitulations of the development which
all mankind has passed through from its primeval days". Freud hoped that once he
had uncovered the inherited fault which underlies mental illness, he might be a-
ble to cure it.

Today's Freudians have moved away from their master's Galtonizing of behavior.
They feel that nurture is more important. Analysis looks for childhood events r-
ather than race-memories. In so doing it is in as much danger as was Freud of t-
rying to unbake the cake of human nature. Any attempt to do so is likely to pro-
ve futile.

The Siamese cat shows how futile the task may be. Siamese have black fur on the
tips of the ears, the tail and the feet, but are white or light brown elsewhere.
The cats carry the "Himalayan" mutation, which is also found in rabbits and gui-
nea pigs (but not, unfortunately, in humans). Breeding experiments show that a
single gene inheirted according to Mendel's laws is involved. At first sight, t-
hen, the Siamese cat fur is set in its nature: if coat color is controlled by j-
ust one gene then surely there is no room for nurture to play a part.

However, the Himalayan mutation is odd. The damaged gene cannot produce pigment
at normal body temperature but works perfectly if it is kept cool. This is why
the colder parts of the cat's body, its ears, nose, and tail (and, for a male,
its testicles) are darker than the rest. An unusually dark cat can be produced
by keeping a typical Siamese in the cold and a light one by bringing it up in a
warm room. Inside every Siamese is a black cat struggling to get out. It is mea-
ningless to ask whether its pattern is due to gene or environment. It is due to
both. What the Siamese cat - and every living creature - inherits is an ability
to respond to the environment in which it is placed.

                                    Taxonomy

Taxonomy, the science of classifying and ordering organisms, has an undeserved
reputation as a harmless, and mindless, activity of listing, cataloguing, and d-
escribing - consider the common idea of a birdwatcher, up at 5:30 in the morning
with binoculars, short pants, and "life list" of every bird he has seen. Even a-
mong scientists, taxonomy is often treated as "stamp collecting". It was not al-
ways so. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, taxonomy was in
the forefront of the sciences. The greatest biologists of Europe were professio-
nal taxonomists - Linnaeus, Cuvier, Lamarck. Darwin's major activity during the
twenty years separating his Malthusian insights from the publication of his evo-
lutionary theory was a three-volume work on the taxonomy of barnacles. Thomas J-
efferson took time out from the affairs of the state to publish one of the great
taxonomic errors in the history of paleontology - he described a giant sloth cl-
aw as a lion's three times the size of Africa's version. These heady days were
marked by discovery as naturalists collected the fauna and flora of previously
uncharted regions. They were also marked by the emergence of intellectual struc-
ture, as coherent classifications seemed to mirror the order of God's thought.

America played its part in this great epoch of natural history. We ofter forget
that 150 years ago much of our continent was as unknown and potentially hazardo-
us as any place on earth. During the eighteenth century, when most naturalists
denied the possibility of extinction, explorers expected to find mammoths and o-
ther formidable fossil creatures alive in the American West. There are a number
of passionate, single-minded iconoclasts who fought the hostility of the wildne-
ss, and often of urban literary people, to disclose the rich fauna and flora of
America. For the most part, they worked alone, with small support from patrons
or government. The Lewis and Clark expedition is an exception - and its primary
purpose was not natural history. We may now look upon tales of frontier toughne-
ss and perseverance as the necessary mythology of a nation too young to have re-
al legends. But there is often a residue of truth in such tales, and naturalists
are among the genuine pioneers.

Alexander Wilson walked from New England to Charleston peddling subscriptions to
his American Ornithology. Thomas Nuttall - oblivious to danger, a Parsifal under
a lucky star, vanquishing every Klingsor in the woods, discovered some of the r-
arest, most beautiful, and most useful of American plants. J.J.Audubon drank his
way across Europe selling his beautiful pictures of birds to lords and kings. J-
ohn Lawson, captured by Tuscarora Indians, met the following fate according to
an eyewitness: "They struck him full of fine small, splinters or torchwoods like
hog's bristles and so set them gradually afire." David Douglas fell into a pit
trap for wild cattle and was stomped to death by a bull.

                           Theories about Alcoholism

One of the many theories about alcoholism is the learning and reinforcement the-
ory, which explains alcoholism by considering alcohol ingestion as a reflex res-
ponse to some stimulus and as a way to reduce an inner drive state such as fear
or anxiety. Characterizing life situations in terms of approach and avoidance,
this theory holds that persons tend to be drawn to pleasant situations and repe-
lled by unpleasant ones. In the latter case, alcohol ingestion is said to reduce
the tension or feelings of unpleasantness and to replace them with the feeling
of euphoria generally observed in most persons after they have consumed one or
more drinks.

Some experimental evidence tends to show that alcohol reduces fear in an approa-
ch-aversion situation. Conger trained one group of rats to approach a food goal
and, using aversion conditioning, trained another group to avoid electric shock.
After an injection of alcohol the pull away from the shock was measurably weake-
r, while the pull toward the food was unchanged.

The obvious troubles experienced by alcoholic persons appear to contradict the
learning theory in the explanation of alcoholism. The discomfort, pain, and pun-
ishment they experience should presumably serve as a deterrent to drinking. The
fact that alcoholic persons continue to drink in the face of family discord, lo-
ss of employment, illness, and other sequels of repeated bouts is explained by
the proximity of the drive reduction to the consumption of alcohol; that is, al-
cohol has the immediate effect of reducing tension while the unpleasant consequ-
ences of drunken behavior come only later. The learning paradigm, therefore, fa-
vors the establishment and repetition of the resort to alcohol.

In fact, the anxietiess and feeling of guilt induced by the consequences of exc-
essive alcohol ingestion may themselves become the signal for another bout of a-
lcohol abuse. The way in which the cue for another bout could be the anxiety it-
self is explained by the process of stimulus generalization: conditions or even-
ts occurring at the time of reinforcement tend to acquire the characteristics of
stimuli. When alcohol is consumed in association with a state of of anxiety or
fear, the emotional state itself takes on the properties of a stimulus, thus tr-
iggering another drinking bout.

The role of punishment is becoming increasingly important in formulating a cause
of alcoholism based on the principles of learning theory. While punishment may
serve to suppress a response, experiments have shown that in some cases it can
serve as a reward and reinforce the behavior. Thus if the alcoholic person has
learned to drink under conditions of both reward and punishment, either type of
condition may precipitate renewed drinking.

Ample experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that excessive alcohol coms-
umption can be learned. By gradually increasing the concentration of alcohol in
drinking water, psychologists have been able to induce the ingestion of larger
amounts of alcohol by an animal than would be normally consumed. Other research-
ers have been able to achieve similar results by varying the schedule of reinfo-
rcement - that is, by requiring the animal to consume larger and larger amounts
of the alcohol solutions before rewarding it. In this manner, animals learn to
drink enough to become dependent on alcohol in terms of demonstrating withdrawal
symptoms.

================================================================================

                            Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Studies have shown that certain components of the immune system behave abnormal-
ly in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. Chemicals called interleukin-2 and
gamma interferon, which the body produces during its battle against cancer and
infectious agents, may not be made in normal amounts. There is evidence that a
low-grade battle is being waged by the immune system of CFS patients, given the
slight increase in the number of white cells that usually accumulate in the blo-
od when people are fighting off an infection. Natural killer cells, though, that
also help the body in this battle are found in slightly reduced numbers. It's i-
mportant to note that clinical depression has the identical small reduction in
natural killer-cell activity. In addition, some depressed patients produce high-
er amounts of antibodies to certain viruses. There may be more of a connection
between depression, the immune system, and chronic fatigue syndrome than is rea-
lized even now, which introduces the somewhat controversial aspect of the syndr-
ome, its neuropsychological features.

================================================================================

                            Antipsychotic Medication

In the 1950s, the development of antipsychotic drugs called neuroleptics radica-
lly changed the clinical outlook for patients in mental institutions who had pr-
eviously been considered hopelessly psychotic. Daily medication controlled delu-
sions and made psychotherapy possible. Many who otherwise might never have left
institutions returned to society. Now physicians have learned that there is a p-
rice to be paid for these benefits. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients
who undergo long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs develop a cluster of s-
ymptoms called tardive dyskinesia, the most common symptoms of which are involu-
ntary repetitive movement of the tongue, mouth, and face, and sometimes the lim-
bs and trunk.

Neuroleptic drugs interfere with the action of dopamine, an important neurotran-
smitter in the brain, by binding to the dopamine receptors of nerve cells, and
dopamine is a prime suspect in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Large doses
of drugs such as amphetamines, which stimulate secretion of dopamine, produce a
psychosis resembling schizophrenia. Reducing the activtiy of this neurotransmit-
ter alleviates the delusions that cause psychotic behavior. Although the inhibi-
tion of dopamine activity can control psychotic behavior, researchers now belie-
ve that the central nervous system of some patients adapts to long-term therapy
by increasing the number of specific dopamine binding sites. The net result is
dopamine hypersensitivity, which is correlated with the subsequent appearance of
tardive dyskinesia.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia is not so great that doctors have con-
sidered abandoning the use of antipsychotic drugs. Patients generally are bothe-
red only slightly by the physical side effects, though the abnormal movement are
troubling and may hinder social adjustment. Additionally, early diagnosis and p-
rompt discontinuation of the neuroleptics might decrease the incidence of the m-
ovement disorders. Unfortunately, without neurologic drugs, psychotic behavior
returns. So researchers have tried to achieve a satisfactory balance between the
two effects, lowering dosage to a level that minimizes movement disorders yet c-
ontrols psychosis. In a five-year study of twenty-seven psychiatric patients tr-
eated with neuroleptics representing all classes of antipsychotic drugs, resear-
chers attempted to decrease drug doses to their lowest effective levels. Patient
responses suggested that low to moderate doses of antipsychotic drugs could con-
trol psychoses just as well as high doses, and tardive dyskinesia symptoms stab-
ilized and gradually diminished or completely disappeared.

The fact that psychoses can be controlled at the same time that tardive dyskine-
sia symptoms are reduced suggests that a drug more specifically affecting the m-
echanism of psychoses might not cause movement disorders. Sulpiride, a drug not
available in the United States but widely used in Europe, where it was develope-
d, may be one such alternative. The drug selectively block D-2 dopamine recepto-
rs, perhaps especially those in the limbic area of the brain, which is involved
in emotion and behavior. It does not adversely affect the adenylate cyclase-lin-
ked D-1 dopamine receptors. Sulpiride has proven effective in the short term, b-
ut whether it suppresses tardive dyskinesia over a long period of treatment is
not yet known.

================================================================================

                               Mental Health Care

The mental health movement in the United States began with a period of consider-
able enlightenment. Dorothea Dix was shocked to find the mentally ill in jails
alms houses and crusaded for the establishment of asylums in which people could
receive hunmane care in hospital-like environments and treatment which might he-
lp restore them to sanity. By the mid-1800s, 20 states had established asylums,
but during the late 1800s and early 1900s, in the face of economic depression,
legislatures were unable to appropriate sufficient funds for decent care. Asylu-
ms became overcrowded and prisonlike. Additionally, patients were more resistant
to treatment than the pioneers in the mental health field had anticipated, and
security and restraint were needed to protect patients and others. Mental insti-
tutions became frightening and depressing places in which the rights of patients
were all but forgotten.

These conditions continued until after World War II. At that time, new treatmen-
ts were discovered for some major mental illnesses theretofore considered untre-
atable (penicillin for syphilis of the brain and insulin treatment for schizoph-
renia and depression), and a succession of books, motion pictures and newspaper
exposes called attention to the plight of the mentally ill. Improvements were m-
ade, and Dr.David Vail's Humane Practices program is a beacon for today. But ch-
anges were slow in coming until the early 1960s. At that time, the Civil Rights
Movement led lawyers to investigate America's prisons, which were disproportion-
ately populated by blacks, and they in turn followed prisoners into the only in-
stitutions that were worse than the prisons - the hospitals for the criminally
insane. The prisons were filled with angry young men who, encouraged by legal s-
upport, were quick to demand their rights. The hospitals for the criminally ins-
ane, by contrast, were populated with people who were considered "crazy" and who
were often kept obediently in their place through the use of severe bodily rest-
raints and large doses of major tranquilizers. The young cadre of public intere-
st lawyers liked their role in the mental hospitals. The lawyers found a popula-
tion that was both passive and easy to champion. These were, after all, people
who, unlike criminals, had done nothing wrong. And in many states they were bei-
ng kept in horrendous institutions, an injustice which, once exposed, was bound
to shock the public and, particularly, the judicial conscience. Patients' right
groups successfully encouraged reform by lobbying in state legislatures.

Judicial interventions have had some definite positive effects, but there is gr-
owing awareness that courts cannot provide the standards and the review mechani-
sms that assure good patient care. The details of providing day-to-day care sim-
ply cannot be mandated by a court, so it is time to take from the courts the re-
sponsibility for delivery of mental health care and assurance of patient rights
and return it to the state mental health administrators to whom the mandate was
originally given. Though it is a difficult task, administrators must undertake
to write rules and standards and to provide the training and surveillance to as-
sure that treatment is given and patients' rights are respected.

================================================================================

                                   "Drug Lag"

From the time they were first proposed, the 1962 Amendments to the Food, Drug a-
nd Cosmetic Act have been the subject to controversy among some elements of the
health community and the pharmaceutical industry. The Amendments added a new re-
quirement for Food and Drug Administration approval of any new drug: The drug m-
ust be demonstrated to be effective by substantial evidence consisting of adequ-
ate and well-controlled investigations. To meet this effectiveness requirement,
a pharmaceutical company must spend considerable time and effort in clinical re-
search before it can market a new product in the United States. Only then can it
begin to recoup its investment. Critics of the requirement argue that the added
expense of the research to establish effectiveness is reflected in higher drug
costs, decreased profits, or both, and that this has resulted in a "drug lag".

The term drug lag has been used in several different ways. It has been argued t-
hat the research required to prove effectiveness creates a lag between the time
when a drug could theoretically be marketed without proving effectiveness and t-
he time when it is actually marketed. Drug lag has also been used to refer to t-
he difference between the number of new drugs introduced annually before 1962 a-
nd the number of new drugs introduced each year after that date. It's also argu-
ed that the Amendments resulted in a lag between the time when new drugs are av-
ailable in other countries and the time when the same drugs are available in the
United States. And drug lag has also been used to refer to a difference in the
number of new drugs introduced per year in other advanced nations and the number
introduced in the same year in the United States.

Some critics have used drug lag arguments in an attempt to prove that the 1962
Amendments have actually reduced the quality of health care in the United States
and that, on balance, they have done more harm than good. These critics recomme-
nd that the effectiveness requirements be drastically modified or even scrapped.
Most of the specific claims of the drug lag theoreticians, however, have been r-
efuted. The drop in new drugs approved annually, for example, began at least as
early as 1959, perhaps five years before the new law fully effective. In most i-
stances, when a new drug was available in a foreign country but not in the Unit-
ed States, other effective drugs for the condition were available in this count-
ry and sometimes not available in the foreign country used for comparison. Furt-
her, although the number of new chemical entities introduced annually dropped f-
rom more than 50 in 1959 to about 12 to 18 in the 1960's and 1970's, the number
of these that can be termed important - some of them of "breakthrough" caliber -
has remained reasonably close to 5 or 6 per year. Few, if any, specific examples
have actually been offered to show how the effectiveness requirements have done
significant harm to the health of Americans. The requirement does ensure that a
patient exposed to a drug has the likelihood of benefiting from it, an assessme-
nt that is most important, considering the possibility, always present, that ad-
verse effects will be discovered later.

================================================================================

                            Health Problems in U.S.

The most damning thing that can be said about the world's best-endowed and rich-
est country is that it is not only the leader in health status, but that it is
so low in the ranks of the nations. The united States ranks 18th among nations
of the world in male life expectancy at birth, 9th in female life expectancy at
birth, and 12th in infant mortality. More importantly, huge variations are evid-
ent in health status in the United States from one place to the next and from o-
ne group to the next.

The forces that affect health can be aggregated into four groupings that lend t-
hemselves to analysis of all health problems. Clearly the largest aggregate of
forces resides in the person's environment. His own behavior, in part derived f-
rom his experiences with his environment, is the next greatest force affecting
his health. Medical care services, treated as separate from other environmental
factors because of the special interest we have in them, make a modest contribu-
tion to health status. Finally, the contributions of heredity to health are dif-
ficult to judge. We are templated at conception as to our basic weaknesses and
strengths, but many hereditary attributes never become manifest because of envi-
ronmental and behavioral forces that act before the genetic forces come to matu-
rity and other hereditary attributes are increasingly being palliated by medical
care.

No other country spends what we do per capita for medical care. The care availa-
ble is among the best technically, even if used too lavishly and thus dangerous-
ly, but none of the countries which stand above us in health status have such a
high proportion of medically disenfanchised persons. Given the evidence that me-
dical care is not that valuable and access to care not that bad, it seems most
unlikely that our bad showing is caused by the significant proportion who are p-
oorly served. Other hypotheses have greater explanatory power: excessive povert-
y, both actual and relative, and excessive affluence.

Excessive poverty is probably more prevalent in the United States than in any of
the countries that have a better infant mortality rate and female life expectan-
cy at birth. This is probably true also for all but four of five of the countri-
es with a longer male life expectancy. In the notably poor countries that exceed
us in male survival, difficult living conditions are a more accepted way of lif-
e, and, in several of them, a good basic diet, basic medical care, basic educat-
ion and lifelong employment opportunities are an everyday fact of life. In the
United States a national unemployment level of 10 percent may be 40 percent in
the ghetto, while less than 4 percent elsewhere. The countries that have surpas-
sed us in health do not have such severe or entrenched problems. Nor are such a
high proportion of their people involved in them.

Excessive affluence is not so obvious a cause of ill health, but, at least until
recently, few other nations could afford such unhealthful ways of living. Exces-
sive intake of animal protein and fats, dangerous imbibing of alcohol, use of t-
obaco and drugs (prescribed and proscribed), and dangerous recreational sports
and driving habits are all possible only because of affluence. Our heritage, de-
sires, opportunities and our macho, combined with the relatively low cost of bad
foods and speedy vehicles, make us particularly vulnerable to our affluence. And
those who are not affluent try harder. Our unacceptable health status, then, wi-
ll not be improved appreciably by expanded medical resources nor by their redis-
tribution so much as a general attempt to improve the quality of life for all.

================================================================================

                                 Drug Labeling

Under existing law, a new drug may be labeled, promoted, and advertised only for
those conditions in which safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated and of
which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved, or so-called "approv-
ed uses". Other uses have come to be called "unapproved uses" and cannot be leg-
ally promoted. In a real sense, the term "unapproved" is a misnomer because it
includes in one phrase two categories of marketed drugs that are very different:
drugs which are potentially harmful and will never be approved, and already app-
roved drugs that have "unapproved" uses. It is common for new research and new
insights to demonstrate valid new uses for drugs already on the market. Also, t-
here are numerous examples of medical progress resulting from the serendipitous
observations and therapeutic innovations of physicians, both important methods
of discovery in the field of therapeutics. Before such advances can result in n-
ew indications for inclusion in drug labeling, however, the available data must
meet the legal standard of substantial evidence derived from adequate and well
controlled clinical trials. Such evidence may require time to develop, and, wit-
hout initiative on the part of the drug firm, it may not occur at all for certa-
in uses. However, because medical literatures on new uses exists and these uses
are medically beneficial, physicians often use these drugs for such purposes pr-
ior to FDA review or changes in labeling. This is referred to as "unlabeled use-
s" of drugs.

A different problem arises when a particular use for a drug has been examined s-
cientifically and has been found to be ineffective or unsafe, and yet physicians
who either are uninformed or who refuse to accept the available scientific evid-
ence continue to use the drug in this way. Such use may have been reviewed by t-
he FDA and rejected, or, in some cases, the use may actually be warned against
in the labeling. This subset of uses may be properly termed "disapproved uses".

Government policy should minimize the extent of unlabeled uses. If such uses are
valid - and many are - it is important that scientifically sound evidence suppo-
rting them be generated and that the regulatory system accommodate them into dr-
ug labeling. Continuing rapid advances in medical care and the complexity of dr-
ug usage, however, makes it impossible for hte government to keep drug labeling
up to date for every conceivable situation. Thus, when a particular use of this
type appears, it is also important, and in the interest of good medical care, t-
hat no stigma attached to "unapproved usage" by practitioners while the formal
evidence is assembled between the time of discovery and the time the new use is
included in the labeling. In the case of "disapproved uses", however, it is pro-
per policy to warn against these in the package insert. Whether use of a drug f-
or these purposes by the uninformed or intransigent physician constitutes a vio-
lation of the current Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is a matter of debate
that involves a number of technical and legal issues. Regardless of that, the i-
nclusion of disapproved uses in the form of contraindications, warnings and oth-
er precautionary statements in package inserts is an important practical deterr-
ent to improper use. Except for clearly disapproved uses, however, it is in the
best interests of patient care that physicians not be constrained by regulatory
statutes from exercising their best judgment in prescribing a drug for both its
approved uses and any unlabeled uses it may have.

                              Laughter and Health

Due to the involuntary, simultaneous contraction of 15 facial muscles, the upper
lip is raised, partially uncovering the teeth and effecting a downward curving
of the furrows that extend from the wings of both nostrils to the corners of the
mouth. This produces a puffing out of the cheeks on the outer side of the furro-
ws. Creases also occur under the eyes and may become permanent at the side edges
of the eye. The eyes undergo reflex lacrimation and vascular engorgement. At the
same time, an abrupt strong expiration of air is followed by spasmodic contract-
ions of the chest and diaphragm resulting in a series of expiration-inspiration
microcycles with interval pauses. The whole body may be thrown backward, shaken,
or convulsed due to other spasmodic skeletal muscle contractions. We call this
condition laughter.

Of all human expressive behaviors, laughter has proven a most fascinating enigma
to philosophers and scientists alike. Its psychology, neurology, and anthropolo-
gical origins and purpose are only partially defined. But its effects and uses
are becoming increasingly apparent to health care professionals.

Laughter is considered to be an innate human response which develops during the
first few weeks of life. Evidence of the innate quality of laughter is seen in
its occurrence in deaf and blind infants and children who are completely without
visual or auditory clues from their environment. Darwin propounded in his _Prin-
ciple of Antithesis_ that laughter develops as the infant's powerful reward sig-
nal of comfort and well-being to the nurturing adult. This signal is totally an-
tithetical perceptually to the screams or cries of distress associated with dis-
comfort. Laughter seems to play an important role in the promotion of social un-
ity, production of a sense of well-being, communication of well-being, and as a
mechanism for coping with stressful situations. Physiologically, both reflexive
(tickle-response) and hear-felt (mental response) laughter effect changes to the
human system which may be significant in the treatment and prevention of illnes-
s. These include laughter's association with an increase in pulse rate, probably
due to increased levels of circulatory catecholamines (blood catecholamine leve-
ls vary directly with the intensity of laughter). There is an increase in respi-
ration. There is a decrease in blood CO2 levels. There is a possible increase in
secretion of brain and pituitary endorphins - the body's natural anesthetics wh-
ich relieve pain, inhibit emotional response to pain, and thus reduce suffering.
There is a decrease in red blood cell sedimentation rate ("sed rate" is associa-
ted with the body's level of infection or inflammation).

While it is possible that the effect laughter and other salutary emotions have
is primarily one of a placebo, this in no way minimizes the therapeutic potenti-
al for these emotions. Hippocrates propounded that the mind and body are one. It
may be possible that there is a physical chemistry associated with the will to
live. Further investigaton of the effects of positive emotions upon health and
well-being may give us the keys to unlocking the power of the life force.

================================================================================

                                     Sleep

Experimental studies of sleep deprivation have been conducted for a number of y-
ears in an effort to determine the function of sleep. Theoretically, if sleep p-
lays any biologically or psychologically essential role in the life of an organ-
ism, that role should become apparent when the organism has been systematically
deprived of sleep. However, the results of the experiments that have been condu-
cted are not clear-cut. In some experiments, subjects deprived of sleep for per-
iod of two hundred hours or more have been able to function on an almost normal
level. The results of certain early studies, which seemed to suggest that psych-
otic-like symptoms, including hallucinations, loss of identity, and bizarre beh-
avior, would routinely occur after a lengthy period of enforced sleeplessness,
have not been confirmed. When these symptoms have occurred, it has generally be-
en in subjects whose history revealed a predisposition to mental instability. In
any case, the adverse effects of sleeplessness have been found to persist only
rarely beyond a one; or two-day period of recovery sleep following the experime-
ntal vigil.

Certain relatively mild reactions to prolonged sleep deprivation do occur with
some regularity. Hand tremors, slurred speech, and insensitivity to visual, aur-
al, and tactile stimulation are common in sleep-deprived subjects. There is usu-
ally some loss of efficiency in the performance of tasks, although the nature a-
nd degree of the loss depends on the type of task imposed. Tasks for which the
subject is able to set his or her own work pace are affected very slightly by s-
leep deprivation. On the other hand, when task itself imposes a particular work
pace, accuracy and efficiency are likely to drop dramatically. Lengthy tasks re-
quiring thirty minutes or more of continuous work are more adversely affected,
as are tasks requiring alertness to fleeting sensory stimuli. Some theorists co-
ntend that the difficulties encountered with work-paced tasks by sleep-deprived
persons can be explained by the phenomenon of "microsleep," momentary lapses in-
to sleep by an otherwise wakeful individual. Microsleep episodes, while brief a-
nd often undetected by the subject, are thought to be likely to cause errors of
omission in the performance of a task.

At the completion of an experimental vigil, most subjects engage in a twelve-to
fourteen-hour period of sleep, after which most effects of the deprivation are
gone. For the first two or three nights after the vigil, the usual pattern of s-
leep stages recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG) is generally disrupted.
The first recovery night includes a much greater amount than usual of stage-4 s-
leep (the deepest form of sleep), with correspondingly shorter periods of stage-
1, stage-2, stage-3, and REM sleep. The second recovery night generally includes
slightly more stage-4 sleep than usual, but more striking is the sharp increase
in REM sleep, the type of sleep associated with dreaming. The marked rebound in
REM sleep after a period of enforced wakefulness generally supports the notion
that some minimum amount of dreaming is necessary for full psychological health,
although it leaves obscure the question as to exactly how or why.

                               Anxiety Disorders

Observers studying anxiety, including Freud, long predicted that brain and cent-
ral nervous system could be found to be functioning abnormally in patients with
serious anxiety disorders. Their predictions remained speculative, however, bec-
ause researchers were limited by the methods and knowledge of their times. Toda-
y, because of recent technological advances, much of the research being done on
anxiety and related disorders focuses on the brain and nervous system. Some bio-
logical research workers attempt to understand anxiety disorders by experimenta-
lly producting anxiety in humans and other animals. Ohters study the physical s-
ymptoms commonly associated with phobias or panic to see whether they play a ro-
le in causing the disorders.

Research on neurotransmitters, the chemicals that carry messages from one nerve
cell to another, has not found serious malfunctions associated with anxiety. But
indirect measures suggest some abnormalities, particularly in the neurotransmit-
ter norepinephrine. Scientists are, however, still far from being able to say w-
hether brain malfunciton - some genetic fault coded into the person's hereditary
apparatus, for example - is the cause of anxiety disorders.

Experts disagree about the meaning of some research findings. One problem they
cite is that while studies focusing on the brain's processing of anxiety-reduci-
ng drugs suggest how the brain functions during episodes of severe anxiety, they
prove nothing definitive. Another problem they cite is that most research has n-
ecessarily been confined to animals; whether the results apply to humans is not
certain. Nevertheless, pieces of the neuroscientific puzzle have been found, and
they are beginning to fall into place.

Investigators have identified several substances over the past few years that c-
an actually produce panic attacks, though apparently only in people who have al-
ready experienced such attacks. This line of evidence suggests that patients su-
bject to panic attacks may be biologically different from other people. It also
offers clues to just what those differences might be. The ability to induce pan-
ic attacks gives research investigators a powerful tool for understanding them.

The most thoroughly studied of the anxiety-producing chemicals is sodium lactat-
e. The use of this substance to induce panic attacks is based on the observation
that some people who suffer extreme episodes of anxiety produce an excessive am-
ount of the chemical lactate after routine exercise. For these people, exercise
can actually set off a panic attack. Researchers have found that sodium lactate
triggers panic attacks in a full 80 percent of patients with panic disorder, but
in less than 20 percent of normal people. Lactate infusions may provide a means
of suggesting which patients are biologically prone to panic attacks and thus a-
pt to respond to drug treatment. It is unlikely, however, that lactate infusions
will ever be a sure test.

Although less intensively studied, caffeine is another substance that can produ-
ce panic attacks in susceptible persons. About half of panic-disorder patients
have panic experiences after consuming a quantitiy of caffeine equivalent to th-
at contained in four or five cups of coffee. (Normal people also experience pan-
ic, but only after they ingest much larger quantities of caffeine.) Caffeine is
thought to produce its effects by blocking the action of a brain chemical known
as adenosine, a naturally occurring sedative. Clinical investigators have found
that many people with panic attacks avoid caffeine after noticing that it cause
attacks.

                               Memory and Emotion

Most of our knowledge about how the brain links memory and emotion has been gle-
aned through the study of so-called classical fear conditioning. In this process
the subject, usually a rat, hears a noise or sees a flashing light that is pair-
ed with a brief, mild electric shock to its feet. After a few such experiences,
the rat responds automatically to the sound or light even in the absence of the
shock. Its reactions are typical to any threatening situation: the animal freez-
es, its blood pressure and heart rate increase, and it startles easily. In the
language of such experiments, the noise or flash is a conditioned stimulus, the
foot shock is an unconditioned stimulus, and the rat's reaction is a conditioned
response, which consists of readily measured behavioral and physiological chang-
es.

Conditioning of this kind happens quickly in rats - indeed, it takes place as r-
apidly as it does in humans. A single pairing of the shock to the sound or sight
can bring on the conditioned effect. Once established, the fearful reaction is
relatively permanent. If the noise or light is administered many times without
an accompnaying electric shock, the rat's response diminishes. This change is c-
alled extinction. But considerable evidence suggests that this behavioral alter-
ation is the result of the brain's controlling the fear response rather than the
elimination of the emotional memory. For example, an apparently extinguished fe-
ar response can recover spontaneously or can be reinstated by an irrelevant str-
essful experience. Similarly, stress can cause the reappearance of phobias in p-
eople who have been successfully treated. This resurrection demonstrates that t-
he emotional memory underlying the phobia was rendered dormant rather than eras-
ed by treatment.

Fear conditioning has proved an ideal starting point for studies of emotional m-
emory for several reasons. First, it occurs in nearly every animal group in whi-
ch it hs been examined: fruit flies, snails, birds, lizards, fish, rabbits, rat-
s, monkeys, and people. Although no one claims that the mechanisms are precisely
the same in all these creatures, it seems clear from studies to date that the p-
athways are very similar in mammals and possibly in all vertebrates. We therefo-
re are confident in believing that many of the findings in animals apply to hum-
ans. In addition, the kinds of stimuli most commonly used in this type of condi-
tioning are not signals that rats - or humans, for that matter - encounter in t-
heir daily lives. The novelty and irrelevance of these lights and sounds help to
ensure that the animals have not already developed strong emotional reactions to
them. So researchers are clearly observing learning and memory at work. At the
same time, such cues do not require complicated cognitive processing from the b-
rain. Consequently, the stimuli permit us to study emotional mechanisms relativ-
ely directly. Finally, our extensive knowledge of the neural pathways involved
in processing acoustic and visual information serves as an excellent starting p-
oint for examining the neurological foundations of fear elicited by such stimul-
i.

                    Blood Identification in Crime Detection

Methods for typing blood were developed around the turn of the century, about t-
he same time that fingerprints were first used for identification. Only in the
last decade or two, however, have scientists begun to believe that genetic mark-
ers in blood and other bodily fluids may someday prove as useful in crime detec-
tion as fingerprints.

The standard ABO blood typing has long been used as a form of negative identifi-
cation. Added sophistication came with the discovery of additional subgroups of
genetic markers in blood and with the discovery that genetic markers are present
not only in blood but also in other bodily fluids, such as perspiration and sal-
iva.

These discoveries were of little use in crime detection, however, because of the
circumstances in which police scientists must work. Rather than a plentiful sam-
ple of blood freshly drawn from a patient, the crime laboratory is likely to re-
ceive only a tiny fleck of dried blood of unknown age from an unknown "donor" on
a shirt or a scrap of rag that has spent hours or days exposed to air, high tem-
perature, and other contaminants.

British scientists found a method for identifying genetic markers more precisely
in small samples. In this process, called electrophoresis, a sample is placed on
a tray containing a gel through which an electrical current is then passed. A t-
rained analyst reads the resulting patterns in the gel to determine the presence
of various chemical markers.

Electrophoresis made it possible to identify several thousand subgroups of blood
types rather than the twelve known before. However, the equipment and special t-
raining required were expensive. In addition, the process could lead to the des-
truction of evidence. For example, repeated test of a blood-flecked shirt - one
for each marker - led to increasing deterioration of the evidence and the cost
of a week or more of laboratory time.

It remained for another British researcher, Brian Wrexall, to demonstrate that
simultaneous analyses, using an inexpensive electrophoresis apparatus, could te-
st for ten different genetic markers within a 24-hour period. This development
made the study of blood and other fluid samples an even more valuable for crime
detection.

                               In Vitro Culturing

Two techniques have recently been developed to simplify research and reduce the
number of nonhuman primates needed in studies of certain complex hormonal react-
ions. One technique involves the culturing of primate pituitary cells and the c-
ells of certain human tumors. In the other, animal oviduct tissue is transplant-
ed under the skin of laboratory primates. Both culturing techniques complement
existing methods of studying intact animals.

With an in vitro culturing technique, researchers are deciphering how biochemic-
al agents regulate the secretion of prolactin, the pituitary hormone that promo-
tes milk production. The cultured cells survive for as long as a month, and they
do not require serum, a commonly used culture ingredient that can influence cel-
lular function and confound study results. One primate pituitary gland may yield
enough cells for as many as 72 culture dishes, which otherwise would require as
many animals.

The other technique allows scientists to monitor cellular differentiation in the
reproductive tracts of female monkeys. While falling short of the long-sought g-
oal of developing an in vitro model of the female reproductive system, the next
best alternative was achieved. The method involves transplanting oviduct tissue
to an easily accessible site under the skin, where the grafted cells behave exa-
ctly as if they were in their normal environment. In about 80 percent of the gr-
afts, blood vessels in surrounding abdominal skin grow into and begin nourishing
the oviduct tissue. Otherwise, the tissue is largely isolated, walled of by the
surrounding skin. A cyst forms that shrinks and swells in tandem with stages of
the menstrual cycle. With about 80 percent of the grafts reestablishing themsel-
ves in the new site, a single monkey may bear as many as 20 miniature oviducts
that are easily accessible for study. Because samples are removed with a simple
procedure requiring only local anesthesia, scientists can track changes in ovid-
uct cell over short intervals. In contrast, repeated analysis of cellular chang-
es within the oviduct itself would require abdominal surgery every time a sample
was taken - a procedure that the animals could not tolerate.

Scientists are using the grating technique to study chlamydia infections, a lea-
ding cause of infertility among women. By infecting oviduct tissues transplanted
into the abdominal skin of rhesus monkeys, researchers hope to determine how the
bacteria cause pelvic inflammatory disease and lesions that obstruct the oviduc-
t. Such research could eventually lead to the development of antibodies to the
infectious agent and a strategy for producing a chlamydia vaccine.

                        Development and Human Immaturity

Man, so the truism goes, lives increasingly in a man-made environment. This pla-
ces a special burden on human immaturity, for it is plain that adapting to such
variable conditions must depend very heavily on opportunities for learning, or
whatever the processes are that are operative during immaturity. It must also m-
ean that during immaturity man must master knowledge and skills that are neither
stored in the gene pool nor learned by direct encounter, but which are contained
in the culture pool - knowledge about values and history, skills as varied as an
obligatory natural language or an optional mathematical one, as mute as levers
or as articulate as myth telling.

Yet, it would be a mistake to leap to the conclusion that because human immatur-
ity makes possible high flexibility, therefore anything is possible for the spe-
cies. Human traits were selected for their survival value over a four-to five-m-
illion-year period with a great acceleration of the selection process during the
last half of that period. There were crucial, irreversible changes during that
final man-making period: recession of formidable dentition, 50-percent increase
in brain volume, the obstetrical paradox - bipedalism and strong pelvic girdle,
larger brain through a smaller birth canal - immature brain at birth, and creat-
ion of what Washburn has called a "technical-social way of life", involving tool
and symbol use.

Note, however, that hominidization consisted principally of adaptations to cond-
itions in the Pleistocene. These preadaptations, shaped in response to earlier
habitat demands, are part of man's evolutionary inheritance. This is not to say
that close beneath the skin of man is naked ape, that civilization is only a ve-
neer. The technical-social way of life is a deep feature of the species adaptat-
ion, but we would err if we assumed a priori that man's inheritance placed no c-
onstraint on his power to adapt. Some of the preadaptations can be shown to be
presently maladaptive. Man's inordinate fondness for fats and sweets no longer
serves his individual survival well. And the human obsession with sexuality is
plainly not fitted for survival of the species now, however well it might have
served to populate the upper Pliocene and the Pleistocene. Nevertheless, note t-
hat the species responds typically to these challenges by technical innovation
rather than by morphological or behavioral change. Contraception dissociates se-
xuality from reproduction. We do not, of course, know what kinds and what range
of stresses are produced by successive rounds of such technical innovation. Dis-
sociating sexuality and reproduction, for example, surely produces changes in t-
he structure of the family, which in turn redefine the role of women, which in
turn alters the authority pattern affecting the child, etc. Continuing and poss-
ible accelerating change seems inherent in such adaptation. And this, of course,
places an enormous pressure on man's uses of immaturity, preparing the young for
unforeseeable change - the more so if there are severe restraints imposed by hu-
man preadaptations to earlier conditions of life.

                              Human Immune System

The key to the human immune system is its ability to distinguish between self a-
nd nonself. Molecules that mark a cell as self are encoded by a group of genes
contained in a section of a specific chromosome and are known as the major hist-
ocompatibility complex, or MHC. An antigen, which is any substance such as a vi-
rus, a bacterium, a fungus, or a parasite that is capable of triggering a respo-
nse, announces its foreignness by means of intricate and characteristic shapes
called epitopes, which protrude from its surface. Cells in the immune system are
capable of recognizing an endless variety of distinguishable epitopes; the body
will even reject nourishing proteins unless they are first broken down by the d-
igestive system into their primary, nonantigenic building blocks. Tissues or ce-
lls from another individual, except an identical twin whose cells carry identic-
al self-markers, also act as antigens. Because MHC genes and the molecules they
encode vary widely in the details of their structure from one individual to ano-
ther - a diversity known as polymorphism, transplants are very likely to be ide-
ntified as foreign by the immune system and rejected.

                                     Lungs

The lungs, shaped roughly like triangles or pyramids, rest in the chest cavity
on the diaphragm (a muscular tissue that separates the abdominal cavity from the
chest). They are separated by the large blood vessels, the esophagus, and the h-
eart.

The main function of the lungs is to keep the body supplied with oxygen (lungs
are unnecessary in water-dwelling animals as water removes the waste gases and
supplies the cells with the needed oxygen). When oxygen enters the lungs, it pe-
rmeates the walls of the air ascs and is absorbed into the bloodstream. The blo-
od travels through the body, giving oxygen to the tissues and receiving carbon
dioxide.

The lungs, consisting primarily of air sacs, average between three and four pou-
nds. Healthy lungs are gray and blotchy in appearance. The idea of the bright p-
ink lung is widespread but erroneous. However, lungs do become grossly discolor-
ed by disease and smoking.

More than five hundred million alveoli (air sacs) are in the lungs. The alveoli
are hollows formed by the bronchioles, which are the smallest version of the air
passages known as the bronchial tubes. The alveoli are clusters (something like
soap suds) that are found at the end of the bronchioles. The right lung has thr-
ee lobes (large cluster of alveoli), while the left lung has two.

                                      Skin

Because human anatomy does not change (except over long periods of time), knowl-
edge acquired a century ago is still accurate today. Broad functions of any part
of the body, such as the skin, are duplicated in different ways by other organs.
One can eventually understand the entire body as a larger system made up of sma-
ller, interdependent systems.

A cross-section of the skin reveals a top layer of epidermis, or cuticle, follo-
wed by derma, and finally, subcutaneous cellular tissue. Sprouting through all
three layers are hairs, with hair follicles and erector pili muscles embedded d-
eep within the subcutaneous tissue. Sweat (sudoriferous glands), fat cells, and
sebaceous glands are scattered throughout, while papillae, which are conical and
extremely sensitive, can be found directly beneath the superficial layer.

The skin is the primary organ of the sense of touch. It can excrete substances
as well as absorb them, and it plays a vital role in regulating body temperature
and in protecting the tissues that lie beneath it.

The epidermis has no veins or arteries and varies considerably both in thickness
and in the depth or fineness of its furrows. On the palm, for example, the skin
is quite thick, or horny, and is marked by deep furrows or lines. On the back of
the hand, however, the skin is less thick, and has only a faint network of lines
crisscrossing it. The pigment found in the epideremis gives whatever color there
is to the skin; this pigment is similar to that found in the retina of the eye.
One layer down, in the derma, there is similar variation in thickness, mostly to
protect underlying tissue.

In the derma lies the vascular system, thich includes nerves, blood vessels, and
lymphatics. The derma is divided into two sub-layers: the reticular layer and t-
he papillary layer, which is closer to the epidermis. The less sensitive the sk-
in, the fewer papillae reside there; in the most sensitive places, such as the
fingertips and the nipples, the papillae are long, large, and grouped closely t-
ogether to form parallel arcs with ducts to sweat glands lying in between. Under
the papillary layer, and conforming to it, is the reticular layer, composed of
fibrous bands and elastic tissue, and interlaced by fat and sudoriferous glands.
The basic functions of muscular contraction, vascular transport, nerve communic-
ation, and protection all take place in the various layers of the skin, so that
understanding the components of the skin and how they work together is a helpful
step in understanding the complex anatomy of the human body.

                                    Obesity

In terms of its prevalence, obesity is the leading disease in the United States.
Obesity may be defined as a condition of excess adipose tissue, as fatness beyo-
nd cultural esthetic norms, or as adipose tissue tending to disrupt good health
of mind and body. A common rule of thumb is that people moe than 20 pounds above
their desirable weights are obese. By this measure, 30 percent of men and 40 pe-
rcent of women in America are obese. Despite the prevalence of the disease, cur-
ative measures are almost impossible for those currently obese; future generati-
ons may be spared.

Adipose tissue is triumph of evolution. Fat yields 9.0 calories per gram, while
carbohydrates and protein each 4.0 calories per gram, and fat contains much less
water than does protein. It is, therefore, much more efficient to store excess
energy as fat than as protein. Primitive man, with uncertain food sources, had
great need for excess fat, but modern Western man, with predictable food supply
and sedentary lifestyle, is burdened by this evolutionary vestige. This is not
to say that modern man has no need at all for adipose tissue; on the contrary,
he needs it if for such important purposes as insulation from cold, and protect-
ion of organs from injury.

The problem Americans face is losing excess adipose tissue, and they turn from
one fad diet to another. Despite a billion-dollar diet industry, the five-year
cure rate of obesity is almost zero. Cancer is more curable. The reasons for th-
is are psychological as well as physiological.

From a physical standpoint, losing a pound or two a week for a few weeks is not
difficult, for most of the loss is in the form of protein and water, and protein
carries with it four times its weight in water. However, when the body has been
in negative nitrogen balance for too long, it acts to correct the situation by
taking in as much or more nitrogen than it excretes. Since protein is the only
source of nitrogen in the diet, any future weight loss must come from adipose t-
issue, the very compactness of which makes losing weight a very slow and tedious
task. If caloric expenditure exceeds intake by 500 calories, only 62 grams of a-
dipose tissue can be lost as compared with 620 grams of protein and associated
water. The body's tendency to return to nitrogen balance can be so strong that
the dieter may actually gain weight while still expending more calories than he
is ingesting. Faced with a discontinuance of weight loss, or even a weight gain,
while still adhering to a previously successful diet tends to lead dieters to s-
uffer depression, hunger, decreased metabolic rate, inactivity, and weakness, w-
hich in turn lead to the diet's abandonment. The strong tendency then is for ra-
pid weight gain, probably from numerous psychological factors as well as such p-
hysiological ones as increased lipid synthesis.

Obese people tend to be hypertensive, diabetic, and, because they are relatively
insensitive to insulin's effects, hyperinsulinemic. Weight loss is associated w-
ith improvement in all these categories. Further, obesity is correlated with in-
creased serum lipids (such as cholisterol), a condition which is additionally s-
ignificant because of its role in atherosclerotic heart disease, by far the lea-
ding cause of death in th United States.

While vigorous attempts to reduce obesity in America should be aimed at all aff-
ected, the most successful efforts are likely to be those directed toward child-
ren. If the advertising and food industries stop trying to sell high-caloric, l-
ow-nutritive-value foods to children, if parents reserve sweets as treats for s-
pecial occasions, and if mothers and fathers are successfully educated to under-
stand that the feeding patterns they impose on their infants and children can d-
etermine the adolescent and adult eating habits those children will develop, the
future generation may not be as fat as ours is.

                         Treatment of Myocardial Injury

Nitroglycerin has long been famous for its relief of angina pectoris attacks but
ruled out for heart attacks on the theory that it harmfully lowers blood pressu-
re and increases heart rate. A heart attack, unlike an angina attack, always in-
volves some localized, fairly rapid heart muscle death, or myocardial infarctio-
n. This acute emergency happens when the arteriosclerotic occlusive process in
one of coronary arterial branches culminates so suddenly and completely that the
local myocardium - the muscle area that was fed by the occluded coronary - stops
contracting and dies over a period of hours, to be replaced over a period of we-
eks by a scar, or "healed infarct".

In 1974, in experiments with dogs, it was discovered that administration of nit-
roglycerin during the acute stage of myocardial injury, provided that the dog's
heart rate and blood pressure were maintained in the normal range. Soon after,
scientists made a preliminary confirmation of the clinical applicability of nit-
roglycerin in acute heart attack in human patients. Five of twelve human subjec-
ts developed some degree of congestive heart failure. Curiously, the nitroglyce-
rin alone was enough to reduce the magnitude of injury in these five patients,
but the other seven patients, whose heart attacks were not complicated by any
congestive heart failure, were not consistently helped by the nitroglycerin unt-
il another drug, phenylephrine, was added to abolish the nitroglycerin-induced
drop in blood pressure. One explanation for this is that the reflex responses in
heart rate, mediated through the autonomic nervous system, are so blunted in co-
ngestive heart failure that a fall in blood pressure prompts less of the cardiac
acceleration which otherwise worsens the damage of acute myocardial infarction.

It appears that the size of the infarct that would otherwise result from a coro-
nary occlusion might be greatly reduced, and vitally needed heart muscle thus s-
aved, by the actions of certain drugs and other measures taken during the acute
phase of the heart attack. This is because the size of the myocardial infarct is
not really determined at the moment of the coronary occlusion as previously tho-
ught. The fate of the stricken myocardial segment remains largely undetermined,
hanging on the balance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand which can be favo-
rably influenced for many hours after the coronary occlusion. So it is possible
to reduce the myocardial ischemic injury during acute human heart attacks by me-
ans of nitroglycerin, either alone or in combination with phenylephrine.

Other drugs are also being tested to reduce myocardial infarct size, particular-
ly drugs presumed to affect myocardial oxygen supply and demand, including not
only vessel dilators such as nitroglycerin but also antihypertensives, which bl-
ock the sympathetic nerve reflexes that increase heart rate and work in response
to exertion and stress. Such measures are still experimental, and there is no p-
roof of benefit with regard to the great complications of heart attack such as
cardiogenic shock, angina, or mortality. But the drugs for reducing infarct size
now hold center stage in experimental frameworks.

                   Preventive Medicine and Curative Medicine

According to legend, Aesculapius bore two daughters, Panacea and Hyegeia, who g-
ave rise to dynasties of healers and hygienists. The schism remains today, in c-
linical training and in practice; and because of the imperative nature of medic-
al care and the subtlety of health care, the former has tended to dominate. Pre-
ventive medicine has as its primary objective the maintenance and promotion of
health. It accomplishes this by controlling or manipulating environmental facto-
rs that affect health and disease. For example, in Califorina presently there is
serious suffering and substantial economic loss because of the failure to intro-
duce controlled fluoridation of public water supplies. Additionally, preventive
medicine applies prophylacitc measures against disease by such actions as immun-
ization and specific nutritional measures. Third, it attempts to motivate people
to adopt healthful life-styles through education.

For the most part, curative medicine has as its primary objective the removal of
disease from the patient. It provides diagnostic techniques to identify the pre-
sence and nature of the disease process. While these may be applied on a mass b-
asis in an attempt to "screen" out persons with preclinical disease, they are u-
sually applied after the patient appears with a complaint. Second, it applies t-
reatment to the sick patient. In every case, this is, or should be, individuali-
zed according to the particular need of each patient. Third, it utilizes rehabi-
litation methodologies to return the treated patient to the best possible level
of functioning.

While it is true that both preventive medicine and curative medicine require ca-
dres of similarly trained personnel such as planners, administrators, and educa-
tors, the underlying delivery systems depend on quite distinctive professional
personnel. The requirements for curative medicine call for clinically trained i-
ndividuals who deal with patients on a one-to-one basis and whose training is b-
ased primarily on an understanding of the biological, pathological, and psychol-
ogical processes that determine an individual's health and disease status. The
locus for this training is the laboratory and clinic. Preventive medicine, on t-
he other hand, calls for a very broad of professional personnel, few of whom re-
quire clinical expertise. Since their actions apply either to environmental sit-
uations or to population groups, their training takes place in a different type
of laboratory or in a community not necessarily associated with the clinical lo-
cus.

The economic differences between preventive medicine and curative medicine have
been extesively descussed, perhaps most convincingly by Winslow in the monograp-
h. _The Cost of Sickness and the Price of Health_. The sickness is almost always
a negative, nonproductive and harmful state. All resources expended to deal with
sickness are therefore fundamentally economically unproductive. Health, on the
other hand, has a very high value in our culture. To the extent that healthy me-
mbers of the population are replaced by sick members, the economy is doubly bur-
dened. Neveretheless, the per capita cost of preventive measures for specific d-
iseases is generally far lower than the per capita cost of curative medicine ap-
plied to treatment of the same disease. Prominent examples are dental caries, p-
oliomyelitis and phenylketonuria.

There is an imperative need to provide care for the sick person within a single
medical care system, but there is no overriding reason why a linkage is necessa-
ry between the two components of a health care system, prevention and treatment.
A natioanl health and medical care program composed of semiautonomous systems f-
or personal health care and medical care would have the advantage of clarifying
ovjectives and strategies and of permitting a more equitable division of resour-
ces between prevention and cure.

                                  Hypertension

Although it is now possibe to bring most high blood pressure under control, the
cause of essential hypertension remains elusive. Undrstanding how hypertension
begins is at least partly a problem of understanding when in life it begins. and
this may be very early - perhaps within the first few months of life. Since the
beginning of the century, physicians have been aware that hypertension may run
in families, but before the 1970's, studies of the familial aggregation of blood
pressure treated only populations 15 years of age or older. Few studies were at-
tempted in younger persons because of a prevailing notion that blood pressures
in this age group were difficult to measure and unreliable and because essential
hypertension was widely regarded as a disease of adults.

In 1971, a study of 700 children, age 2 to 14, used a special blood pressure re-
corder which minimizes observer error and allows for standardization of blood p-
ressure readings. Before then, it had been well established that the blood pres-
sure of adults aggregates familiarly, that is, the similarities between the blo-
od pressure of an individual and his siblings are generally too great to be exp-
lained by chance. The 1971 study showed that familial clustering was measurable
in children as well, suggesting that factors responsible for essential hyperten-
sion are acquired in childhood. Additional epidemiological studies demonstrated
a clear tendency for the children to retain the same blood pressure patterns, r-
elative to their peers, four years later. Thus, a child with blood pressure hig-
her or lower than the norm would tend to remain higher or lower with increasing
age.

Meanwhile, other investigators uncovered a complex of physiologic roles - inclu-
ding blood pressure - for a vasoactive system called the kallikrein-kinin syste-
m. Kallikreins are enzymes in the kidney and blood plasma which act on precurso-
rs called kininogens to produce vasoactive peptides called kinins. Several diff-
erent kinins are produced, at least three of which are powerful blood vessel di-
lators. Apparently, the kallikrein-kinin system normally tends to offset the el-
evations in arterial pressure that result from the secretion of salt-conserving
hormones such as aldosterone on the one hand and from activation of the sympath-
etic nervous system (which tends to constrict blood vessels) on the other hand.

It is also known that urinary kalikrein excretion is abnormally low in subjects
with essential hypertension. Levels of urinary kallikrein in children are inver-
sely related to the diastolic blood pressures of both children and their mother-
s. Children with the lowest kallikrein levels are found in the families with the
highest blood pressures. In addition, black children tend to show somewhat lower
urinary kallikrein levels than white children, and blacks are more likely to ha-
ve high blood pressure. There is a great deal to be learned about the biochemis-
try and physiologic roles of the kallikrein-kinin system. But there is the poss-
ibility that essential hypertension will prove to have biochemical precursors.

                                    Asbestos

In Aachen, Germany, and environs, many children have been found to have an unus-
ually high lead content in their blood and hair. The amount of lead in the chil-
dren tested has risen above the amount found in workers in heavy-metal industri-
es. The general public is no longer surprised that the lead has been traced to
Stolberg near Aachen: Stolberg is surrounded by brass foundries and slag heaps
which supply building materials to construct schoolyards and sports halls.

This is but one example ...

When Dr. John W. Gofman, professor of medical physics at the University of Cali-
fornia and a leading nuclear critic, speaks of "ecocide" in his adversary view
of nuclear technology, he means the following: A large nuclear plant like that
in Kalkar, the Netherland, would produce about 200 pounds of plutonium each yea-
r. One pound, released into the atmosphere, could cause 9 billion cases of lung
cancer. This waste product must be stored for 500,000 years before it is of no
further danger to man. In the anticipated reactor economy, it is estimated that
there will be 10,000 tons of this material in western Europe, of which one tabl-
espoonful of plutonium-239 represents the official maximum permissible body bur-
den for 200,000 people. Rather than being biodegradable, plutonium destroys bio-
logical properties.

In 1972 the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ruled that the a-
sbestos level in the work place should be lowered to 2 fibers per cubic centime-
ter of air, but the effective date of the ruling has been delayed until now. The
International Federation of Chemical and General Worker's Unions report that the
2-fiber standard was based primarily on one study of 290 men at British asbestos
factory. But when the workers at the British factory had been reexamined by ano-
ther physician, 40-70 percent had x-ray evidence of lung abnormalities. Accordi-
ng to present medical information at the factory in question, out of a total of
29 deaths thus far, seven were caused by lung cancer and three by mesothelioma,
a cancer of the lining of the chest-abdomen. An average European or American wo-
rker comes into contact with six million fibers a day. And when this man returns
home at night, samples of this fireproof product are on his clothes, in his hai-
r, in his lunchpail. "We are now, in fact, finding cancer deaths within the fam-
ily of the asbestos worker," states Dr. Lrving Selikoff, of the Mount Sinai Med-
ical School in New York.

It is now also clear that vinyl chloride, a gas from which the most widely used
plastics are made, causes a fatal cancer of the blood-vessel cells of the liver.
However, the history of the research on vinyl chloride is, in some ways, more d-
isturbing than the "Watergate cover-up". "There has been evidence of potentially
serious disease among polyvinyl chloride workers for 25 years that has been inc-
ompletely appreciated and inadequately approached by medical scientists and by
regulatory authorities," summed up Dr. Selikoff in the _New Scientist_. At least
17 workers have been killed by vinyl chloride because research over the past 25
years was not followed up. And for 10 years, workers have been exposed to conce-
ntrations of vinyl chloride 10 times the "safe limit" imposed by Dow Chemical C-
ompany. In the United Kingdom, a threshold limit value was set after the discov-
ery of the causal link with osteolysis, but the limit was still higher than that
set by Dow Chemical. The Germans set a new maximum level in 1970, but also high-
er than that set by Dow. No other section of U.S. or European industry has foll-
owed Dow's lead.

                                   Literature

In the collected body of writing we call literature, there may be distinguished
two separate groupings, capable of blending, but also fitted for reciprocal rep-
ulsion. There is first the literature of knowledge, and secondly the literature
of power. The function of the first is to teach; the function of the second is
to move. The first is a rudder, the second an oar or sail. The first speaks to
the mere discursive understanding; the second speaks ultimately to the higher u-
nderstanding or reason, but always through the affections of pleasure and sympa-
thy. Whenever we talk in ordinary language of seeking information or gaining kn-
owledge, we understand the words as connected with absolute novelty. But it is
the grandeur of all truth which can occupy a very high place in human interests,
although it may not be absolutely novel even to the meanest of minds.

What do we learn from _Paradise Lost_? Nothing at all. What do we learn from a
cookbook? Something new, something we did not know before, in every paragraph.
But would we therefore put the wretched cookbook on a higher level of estimation
than the divine poem? What we owe to Milton is not any knowledge, of which a mi-
llion separate items are still but a million advancing steps on the same earthly
level; what we owe is power, that is, exercise and expansion of your own latent
capacity of sympathy with the infinite, where every pulse and each separate inf-
lux is a step upwards - a step ascending as upon Jacob's ladder from earth to m-
ysterious altitudes above the earth. All the steps of knowledge, from first to
last, carry us farther on the same plane, but could never raise us one foot abo-
ve your ancient level on earth; whereas, the very first step of power is flight
- an ascending into another element where earth is forgotten.

================================================================================

                            Literature and Business

Literature is at once the most intimate and the most articulate of the arts. It
cannot impart its effect through the senses or the nerves as the other arts can;
it is beautiful only through the intelligence; it is the mind speaking to the m-
ind; until it has been put into absolute terms, of an invariable significance,
it does not exist at all. It cannot awaken this emotion in one, and that in ano-
ther; if it fails to express precisely the meaning of the author, if it does not
say _him_, it says nothing, and is nothing. So that when a poet has put his hea-
rt, much or little, into a poem, and sold it to a magazine, the scandal is grea-
ter than when a painter has sold a picture to a patron, or a sculptor has model-
ed a statue to order. These are artists less articulate and less intimate than
the poet; they are more exterior to their work; they are less personally in it;
they part with less of themselves in the dicker. It does not change the nature
of the case to say that Tennyson and Longfellow and Emerson sold the poems in w-
hich they couched the most mystical messages their genius was charged to bear m-
ankind. They submitted to the conditions which none can escape; but that does n-
ot justify the conditions, which are none the less the conditions of hucksters
because they are imposed upon poets. If it will serve to make my meaning a litt-
le clearer, we will suppose that a poet has been crossed in love, or has suffer-
ed some real sorrow, like the loss of a wife or child. He pours out his broken
heart in verse that shall bring tears of sacred sympathy from his readers, and
an editor pays him a hundred dollars for the right of bringing his verse to the-
ir notice. It is perfectly true that the poem was not written for these dollars,
but it is perfectly true that it was sold for them. The poet must use his emoti-
ons to pay his provision bills; he has no other means; society does not propose
to pay his bills for him. Yet, and at the end of the ends, the unsophisticated
witness finds the transaction ridiculous, finds it repulsive, finds it shabby.
Somehow he knows that if our huckstering civilization did not at every moment v-
iolate the eternal fitness of things, the poet's song would have been given to
the world, and the poet would have been cared for by the whole human brotherhoo-
d, as any man should be who does the duty that every man owes it.

The instinctive sense of the dishonor which money-purchase does to art is so st-
rong that sometimes a man of letters who can pay his way otherwise refuses pay
for his work, as Lord Byron did, for a while, from a noble pride, and as Count
Tolstoy has tried to do, from a noble conscience. But Byron's publisher profited
by a generosity which did not reach his readers; and the Countess Tolstoy colle-
cts the copyright which her husband foregoes; so that these two eminent instanc-
es of protest against business in literature may be said not to have shaken its
money basis. I know of no others; but there may be many that I am culpably igno-
rant of. Still, I doubt if there are enough to affect the fact that Literature
is Business as well as Art, and almost as soon. At present business is the only
human solidarity; we are all bound together with that chain, whatever interests
and tastes and principles separate us.

================================================================================

                               Classic Literature

The large majority of our fellow citizens care as much about literature as they
care about archaeology or the program of the legislature. They do not entirely
ignore it; they are not quite indifferent to it. But their interest in it is fa-
int and perfunctory; or, if their interest happens to be intense, it is spasmod-
ic. Ask the two hundred thousand persons whose enthusiasm made the vogue of a p-
opular novel ten years ago what they think of that novel now, and you will gath-
er that they have utterly forgotten it.

In the face of this, one may ask: Why does the great and universal fame of clas-
sic authors continue? The answer is that the fame of classic authors is entirely
independent of the majority. Do you suppose that if the fame of Shakespeare dep-
ended on the man in the street it would survive for a fortnight? The fame of cl-
assic authors is originally made, and it is maintained, by a passionate few.

Even on those rare occassions when a first-calss author has enjoyed immense suc-
cess during his lifetime, the majority have never appreciated him so sincerely
as they have appreciated second-rate writers. The first-class author has always
been reinforced by the ardor of the passionate few. And in the case of an author
who emerged into glory after his death, this has been due solely to the obstina-
te perseverance of the few. They kept on savoring him, and talking about him, a-
nd buying him, and they generally behaved with such eager zeal, and they were so
authoritative and sure of themselves, that at last the majority grew accustomed
to the sound of his name and placidly agreed to proposition that he was a geniu-
s. The majority really did not care very much either way.

What causes the passionate few to make such a fuss about literature? There can
be only one reply. They find a keen and lasting pleasure in it. They enjoy lite-
rature as some people enjoy beer. And what are the qualities of a book which gi-
ve keen and lasting pleasure to the passionate few? This is a question so diffi-
cult that it has never yet been completely answered. You may talk lightly about
truth, insight, knowledge, wisdom, humor, and beauty, but these comfortable wor-
ds do not really carry you very far, for each of them has to be defined, especi-
ally the first and last. It is all very well for Keats in his airy manner to as-
sert that beauty is truth, truth is beauty, and that is all he knows or needs to
know. I, for one, need to know a lot more. And I shall never know. Nobody, not
even a great critic like Hazily or Sainte-Beuve, has ever finally explained why
he thought a book beautiful.

A classic is work which gives pleasure to the minority which is intensely perma-
nently interested in literature. It lives on because the minority, eager to ren-
ew the sensation of pleasure, is eternally curious and is therefore engaged in
an eternal process of rediscovery. A classic does not survive for any ethical r-
eason. It does not survive because it conforms to certain canons or rules. It s-
urvives because it is a source of pleasure.

================================================================================

                            Importance of Literature

In reaction to a rigid, overrefined classical curriculum, some educational phil-
osophers have swung sharply to an espousal of "life experience" as the sole sou-
rce of learning. Using their narrow interpretation of John Dewey's theories for
support and spouting such phrases as "Teach the child, not the subject", they d-
emand an end to rigorous study and insist that only through doing can learning
take place. While not all adherents to this philosophy would totally eliminate
the study of great books, the gradual subordination of literature in the school
curriculum reflects their influence.

What is the purpose of literature? Why read if life alone is to be our teacher?
James Joyce tells us that the artist reveals the human condition by re-creating
life out of life; Atistotle, that art presents universal truths because its form
is taken from nature. Thus, consciously or otherwise, great writers extend our
understanding of ourselves and our world. We can soar with them to the heights
of aspiration or plummet with them to the depths of despair. How much wider is
the understanding we gain from reading than from viewing life through the keyho-
le of our individual experience.

This function of literature, the enlarging of our life sphere, is of major impo-
rtance in itself. Additionally, however, literature suggests solutions to social
problems. The overweening ambitions of political leaders - and their sneering c-
ontempt for the law - did not appear for the first time in the writings of Bern-
stein and Woodward. The problems and behavior of the guilt-ridden did not await
the appearance of the bearded psychoanalysts of the nineteenth century.

Federal Judge Learned Hand wrote, "I venture to believe that it is as important
to a judge called upon to pass on a question of constitutional law, to have at
least a bowing acquaintance with Thucydides, Gibbon, and Carlyle, with Homer, D-
ante, Shakespeare, and Milton, with Montaigne and Rabelais, with Plato, Bacon,
Hume, and Kant, as with the books which have been specifically written on the s-
ubject. For in such matters everything turns upon the spirit in which he approa-
ches the questions before him."

How do we overcome our dissenters? We must start with the field of agreement: t-
he belief that education should serve to improve the individual and society. We
must persuade our dissenters that the voices of human experience stretch our hu-
man faculties and open us to learning. We must convince them of the unity of li-
fe and art. We much prove to them that far from being separate, literature is t-
hat part of life that illumines life.

================================================================================

                           Literature in the Twenties

Literary periods are slippery concepts. When dates are established and cultural
developments are outlined, predecessors and successors have a way of making them
dissolve. One discovers that the Romantic Period in English literature so comfo-
rtably introduced as extending from 1800 to 1830 has long Pre-Romantic developm-
ent and that it really isn't over yet. The same thing is true of American liter-
ary history, perhaps more so. But if there is one date that seems to make a dec-
isive cut in the continuity of twentieth-century America, it is probably the st-
ock market crash at the end of October 1929. By 1930 reassessmetn was forced on
the American consciousness.

The Twenties have a character of their own, an individualized and particularized
decade for which there has come to be felt considerable nostalgia among the old-
er generation. Clear memories can hardly regard these years as the good old days
(this was the era of prohibition and gangsters), but one of the blessings of the
human condition is the tendency to forget unpleasantness and remember what one
chooses to remember. Perhaps even the Sixties will become a happy recollection
in the twenty-first century.

Three major designations arose in the Twenties to define the Twenties as a cult-
ural phenomenon: the Jazz Age, the Lost Generation, and the Wasteland - all with
significant literary associations. Of them all the Jazz Age, as represented best
in F.Scott Fitzgerald's fiction, was most clearly cut off by the stock market c-
ollapse and the ensuing depression. It is the period of the Twenties alone. But
the Lost Generation (as proclaimed in the double epigraph from Ecclesiastes and
Gertrude Stein in the 1926 _The Sun Also Rises_ - "You are all a lost generatio-
n." - Gertrude Stein in conversation) continued to be lost in the Thirties. The
uprootedness and disillusionment of the post-World War I fiction writers, many
of whom had participated in that war and perhaps particualrly of the Paris expa-
triate group including Hemingway, Elliot Paul, Henry Miller, and others, pursued
them into the depression and beyond. The third term, the Wasteland, established
by T.S. Eliot in his 1922 poem, had perhaps an even longer life; it has come to
represent an age extending from the Twenties to 1945 and may indeed suggest the
central features of the landscape of this larger period. The Wasteland poets, i-
ncluding Ezra Pound, Eliot himself, and possibly William Carlos Williams, Archi-
bald MacLeish, and e.e. Cummings, although many of them had written distinctive
poetry even before 1920 and certainly before 1930, continued to develop and sha-
rpen both their verse and their ideas into the Thirties and Forties. The Wastel-
and runs into and disappers in the Age of Anxiety. Such American writers as Ger-
trude Stein, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Williams, Cummings, and Hemingway are incl-
uded in the post-1930 Canon rather than in the pre-1930 one. They had all certa-
inly made a mark in the literary world before 1930, but they were ahead of their
time and made a larger and deeper mark after that date.

================================================================================

                                   Naturalism

Naturalism differs from realism in several aspects, none of which is clear-cut
and definitive. It tends to be more doctrinaire in its exposition of pseudoscie-
ntific principles, it is less interested in character and more in the conflict
of social forces, and it is concerned to a greater extent with the sordid, the
shocking, and the depressing sides of existence. By these criteria, however, th-
ere are naturalistic elements in Dostoevsky; and Galsworthy, Hemingway, and Sco-
tt Fitzgerald demonstrate many qualities of typical realists. Some further sugg-
ested qualities of literary naturalism are as follows:

(a) Naturalism is scientific or pseudoscientific in its approach; it attempts to
treat human beings as biological pawns rather than agents of free will. The aut-
hor does not attempt to judge his characters or to comment on their actions; he
merely inserts them into a crucial situation and then pretends to stand back and
watch them with the impassivity of the scientists. Although Zola applied this p-
rinciple with some success, it has generally remained a synthetic theory and has
only infrequently been applied to actual literary works.

(b) The naturalist attempts to make literature into a document of society. He w-
rites "novel cycles" purporting to cover every aspect of modern life, or creates
characters who are personifications of various social classes. Many naturalists
gather copious data from actual life and include it in their literary works: th-
ey write novels around specific occupations such as railroading or textile manu-
facturing in which they utilize technical details of the trade for story-intere-
st. This aspect of naturalism represents an attempt to remove literature from t-
he realm of the fine arts into the field of the social sciences.

(c) Because of the above-described documentary nature of naturalism, the techni-
que often involves the conscious suppression of the poetic elements in literatu-
re. The prose style is flat, objective, and bare of imagery; it includes copious
details and explanations, and is wary of highly literary metaphors. Like the ps-
eudoscientific dogma described in (a) above, this quality is often more theoret-
ical than practical. The best naturalists are those who do not totally abandon
the literary traditions of the past. On the other hand some naturalists are mer-
ely writers lacking in the poetic instinct; they avoid a highly literary prose
because they have little feeling fore style and imagery. Others like Hardy are
essentially poets who achieve highly poetic effects in their prose.

(d) Natualistic literature tends to be concerned with the less elegant aspects
of life; its typical settings are the slum, the sweatshop, the factory, or the
farm. Where the romantic author selects the most pleasant and idealistic elemen-
ts in his experience, the naturalistic author often seems positively drawn towa-
rd the brutal, the sordid, the cruel, and the degraded. This tendency is in part
a reaction against earlier literature, especially against the sentimentalism of
the Dumas school where vice is invariably made to appear romantic. The real mov-
ivating forces in a naturalistic novel are not religion, hope, or human idealis-
m; they are alcohol, filth, disease, and the human instinct toward bestiality.
It will be seen immediately that there are important exceptions to this princip-
le. Galsworthy's scenes are middle-class, and Scott Fitzgerald prefers to do his
slumming at the Ritz.

================================================================================

                                     Satire

Satire attained a dominating position between 1660 and 1730 that it had not had
before. As an oblique expression of the writer's wish to reform society, or as
the somewhat baser tool of his scorn and ridicule, Restoration satire had diver-
se outlets. Political parties, religious sects, and fashionable philosophies we-
re as much the delights of satirists as were topical gossip and assorted fops,
pedants, and bigots.

Pope's mock heroic epic, _The Rape of the Lock_, probes the excesses of romantic
etiquette: Lady Belinda's tresses are cropped by a suitor while she lingers over
her coffee. According to Samuel Johnson, such an incident was a questionable to-
pic for poetic treatment: "The subject of the poem is an event below the common
incidents of common life..." Yet the frivolous subject matter provides the ideal
setting for a gentle lambasting of traditional epic machinery and a delicate ex-
posure of the romantic conventions of the day.

================================================================================

                                 Musical Novels

Literary critics are fond of referring to a work as a "musical novel" whenever a
writer employs techniques that can be conveniently described in muscial termino-
logy, but the notion that all such works are of the same genre is an oversimpli-
fication. In _The Waves_, Virginia Woolf uses musical techniques to evoke image-
ry. In _Moderato Cantabile_, Marguerite Duras follows the form of the first mov-
ement of a sonata. When most literary critics pronounce both _The Waves_ and _M-
oderato Cantabile_ "musical novels", it is these gross features that they have
in mind; and so they overlook what makes _Moderato Cantabile_ a truly musical n-
ovel: It is actually "heard" by the reader. The novel is mostly dialogue punctu-
ated by the sounds of a radio, boats, and crowds, like musical phrases defined
by rests; all that we know and all that we need to know of Anne and Chauvin is
what we hear them say. Ironically, this technique that makes _Moderato Cantabil-
e_ more successful than _The Waves_ as a "musical novel" may account for Duras'
relative lack of success as a film-maker. Despite the great success of her "scr-
eenplay for: hiroshima, Mon Amour", few of the 19 films that she wrote and dire-
cted did well, primarily because words often replaced action entirely.

================================================================================

                                 Black Writers

There can be no doubt that the emergence of the Negro writer in the post-war pe-
riod stemmed, in part, from the fact that he was inclined to exploit the opport-
unity to wrtie about himself. It was more than that, however. The movement that
has variously been called the "Harlem Renaissance," the "Black Renaissance," and
the "New Negro Movement" was essentially a part of the growing interest of Amer-
ican literary circles in the immediate and pressing social and economic problem-
s. This growing interest coincided with two developments in Negro life that fos-
tered the growth of the New Negro Movement. These two factors, the keener reali-
zation of injustice and the improvement of the capacity for expression, produced
a crop of Negro writers who constituted the "Harlem Renaissance".

The literature of the Harlem Renaissance was, for the most part, the work of a
race-conscious group. Through poetry, prose, and song, the writers cried out ag-
ainst social and economic wrongs. They protested against segregation and lynchi-
ng. They demanded higher wages, shorter hours, and better conditions of work. T-
hey stood for full social equality and first-class citizenship. The new vision
of social and economic freedom which they had did not force them to embrace the
several foreign ideologies that sought to sink their roots in some American gro-
ups during the period.

The writers of the Harlem Renaissance, bitter and cynical as some of them were,
gave little attention to the propaganda of the socialists and communists. The e-
ditor of the _Messenger_ ventured the opinion that the New Negro was the "produ-
ct of the same world-wide forces that have brought into being the great liberal
and radical movements that are now seizing the reins of power in all the civili-
zed countries of the world." Such forces may have produced the New Negro, but t-
he more articulate of the group did not resort to advocating the type of politi-
cal action that would have subverted American constitutional government. Indeed,
the writers of the Harlem Renaissance were not so much revolting against the sy-
stem as they were protesting its inefficient operation. In this approach they p-
roved as characteristically American as any writers of the period. Like his con-
temporaries, the Negro writer was merely becoming more aware of America's press-
ing problems; and like the others, he was willing to use his art, not only to c-
ontribute to the great body of American culture but to improve the culture of w-
hich he was a part.

It seems possible, moreover, for the historian to assign to the Negro writer a
role that he did not assume. There were doubtless many who were not immediately
concerned with the injustices heaped on the Negro. Some contrived their poems,
novels, and songs merely for the sake of art, while others took up their pens to
escape the sordid aspects of their existence. If there is an element of race in
their writings, it is because the writings flow out of their individual and gro-
up experiences. This is not to say that such writings were not effective as pro-
test literature, but rather that not all the authors were conscious crusaders f-
or a better world. As a matter of fact, it was this detachment, this objectivit-
y, that made it possible for many of the writers of the Harlem Renaissance to a-
chieve a nobility of expression and a poignancy of feeling in their writings th-
at placed them among the masters of recent American literature.

                                 Women Writers

As the works of dozens of women writers have been rescued from what E.P. Thomps-
on calls "the enormous condescension of posterity", and considered in relation
to each other, the lost continent of the female tradition has risen like Atlant-
is from the sea of English literature. It is now becoming clear that, contrary
to Mill's theory, women have had a literature of their own all along, The woman
novelist, according to Vineta Colby, was "really neither single nor anomalous",
but she was also more than a "register and spokesman for her age". She was part
of a tradition that had its origins before her age, and has carried on through
our own.

Many literary historians have begun to reinterpret and revise the study of women
writers. Ellen Moers sees women's literature as an international movement, "apa-
art from, but hardly subordinate to the mainstream: an undercurrent, repid and
powerful. This 'movement' began in the late eighteenth century, was multination-
al, and produced some of the greatest literary works of two centuries, as well
as most of the lucrative pot-boilers." Patricia Meyer Spacks, in _The Female Im-
agination_, finds that "for readily discernible historical reasons women have c-
haracteristically concerned themselves with matters more or less peripheral to
male concerns, or at least slightly skewed from them. The differences between t-
raditional female preocupations and roles and male ones make a difference in fe-
male writing". Many other critics are beginning to agree that when we look at w-
omen writers collectively we can see an imaginative continuum, the recurrence of
certain patterns themes, problems and images from generation to generation.

This book is an effort to describe the female literary tradition in the English
novel from the generation of the Brontes to the present day, and to show how the
development of this tradition is similar to the development of any literary sub-
culture. Women have generally been regarded as "sociological chameleons", taking
on the class, lifestyle, and culture of their male relatives. It can, however,
be argued that women themselves have constituted a subculture within the framew-
ork of a larger society, and have been unified by values, conventions, experien-
ces, and behaviors impinging on each individual. It is important to see the fem-
ale literary tradition in these broad terms, in relation to the wider evolution
of women's self-awareness and to the ways any minority group finds its direction
of self-expression relative to a dominant society, because we cannot show a pat-
tern of deliberate progress and accumulation. It is true, as Ellen Moers wtites,
that "women studied with a special closeness the works written by their own sex"
; in terms of influences, borrowings, and affinities, the tradition is strongly
marked. But it is also full of holes and hiatuses, because of what Germaine Gre-
er calls the "phenomenon of the transience of female literary fame"; almost uni-
nterruptedly since the Interregnum, a small group of women have enjoyed dazzling
literary prestige during their own lifetimes; only to vanish without trace from
the records of posterity. Thus each generation of women writers has found itsel-
f, in a sense, without a history, forced to rediscover the past anew, forging a-
gain and again the consciousness of their sex. Given this perpetual disruption,
and also the self-hatred that has alienated women writers from a sense of colle-
ctive identity, it does not seem possible to speak of a movement.

                           Americans' Self-confidence

Nearly every foreign traveler who visited the United States during the first de-
cade of the nineteenth century carried away an impression sober if not sad. A t-
housand miles of desolate and dreary forest, broken here and there by settlemen-
ts; along the seacoast a few flourishing towns devoted to commerce; no arts, a
provincial literature, the evil of slavery, and political differences fortified
within geographical lines - what could be hoped for such a country?

Ages must probably pass before the interior of the country could be thoroughly
setteld. Even President Thomas Jefferson, usually and optimist, talked resigned-
ly of a thousand years, and in his first Inaugural Address, at a time when the
Mississippi River formed the western boundary of the nation, spoke of the count-
ry as having "room enough for our descendants to the hundredth and thousandth g-
eneration". No prudent person dared to act on the assumption that, when the con-
tinent was settled, one government could include the whole; and when the vast e-
xpanse broke up, as seemed inevitable, into a collection of separate nations, o-
nly discord, antagonism, and wars could be expected.

The mass of Americans are sanguine and self-confident partly by temperament, but
partly also by reason of ignorance; for they knew little of the difficulties wh-
ich beset a complex society. The Duc de Liancourt, like many critics, was struck
by this trait. Among other examples, he met with one in the person of Pennsylva-
nia miller, Thomas Lea, "a sound American patriot, believing that nothing good
is done, and that no one has any brains, except in America; that the wit, the i-
magination, the genius of Europe are in decline"; and the duke added, "This err-
or is to be found in almost all Americans - legislators and administrators, as
well as millers - and is less innocent there."

In the year 1796 the House of Representatives had considered inserting in their
Reply to the President's Speech a remark that the nation was "the freest and mo-
st enlightened in the world" - a nation as yet in its infancy, with neither lit-
erature, arts, sciences, nor history. The moment was particularly ill chosen for
such a claim, because Europe was on the verge of an outbreak of genius. Goethe
and Schiller, Mozart and Haydn, Kant and Fichte, Cavendish adn Herschel were ma-
king way for Scott, Wordsworth, and Shelley, Heine and Balzac, Beethoven and He-
gel - great physicists, biologists, chemists, mathematicians, historians, write-
rs, and musicians by the score.

The idea that Europe was in her decrepitude merely proved the ignorance and want
of enlightenment of most Americans. The error could be excused only by the plea
that, in matters which most concerned Americans, Europe was a full century behi-
nd them. If they were right in thinking that the next necessity in human progre-
ss was to lift the average person upon an intellectual and social level with the
most favored, they stood at least three generations nearer than Europe to that
goal. But the assumption that equality was the necessary objective of civilizat-
ion was itself a dubious one.

                            First World War Writers

The generation of British writers who participated in the First World War are o-
ften considered as a group, united as they were by university education and upp-
er class backgrounds, as well as their shared sense of the horror and absurdity
of the world's first thoroughly mechanized war. The "Great War" combined nearly
unimaginable destruction (in the quietest intervals, 7,000 British soldiers were
killed or wounded daily) with the sheer inanity of seemingly interminable trench
stalemate. The writer/officer was in an ideal position to witness the farcical
polarities of such a war: the idealism of the newly enlisted soldier and the cy-
nicism of the veteran; the peaceful French countryside and the nightmare to bom-
bardment; the earnest battle strategies and the stagnation of perpetual conflic-
t. Paul Fusel, in The Great War and Modern Memory, asserts that to these writers
"the great tragic satire which was the war [was] seen to consist of its own sma-
ller constituent satires, or ironic actions".

Irony was the formal strategy chosen by each author as he confronted the war on
paper. Fusel notes that this device, unprecedented in the literature of war, al-
lowed the "trench writers" to avoid both sentimentality and understatement-eith-
er of which would have diminished the tragic absurdity of the situation. Ironic
detachment provided the psychological distance necessary to commit to paper wha-
t was almost beyond description.

Frequently, the ironic mode was used to intensify the horror rather than to off-
set it. One reads of saturation bombing, bayonetting, and gassing within a world
incongruously filled with poppies, gardens, sheep, and shepherds. By casting mo-
dern carnage in the pastoral imagery familiar from a long English poetic tradit-
ion, these authors deepened the sense of brutal paradox. Thus, as Fussell notes,
Wilfred Owen's metaphor of "The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells" both
"gauges the obscenity of industrialized murder and returns us for a fleeting in-
stant to the pastoral world where the 'choirs' consist of genign insects and bi-
rds". Where Owen suggested this pastoral tradition only through allusion. Edmund
Blunden, in _Understones of War_, describes the havoc wreaked on an actual past-
oral setting: - the greensward, suited by nature for the raising of sheep, was
all holes, and new ones appeared with a great uproar as we passed.

The imprint of the Great War on literary sensibility proved indelible; in diffe-
rent wasys, the writers of the Second World War, and even of Korea and Vietnam,
drew on the ironic tradition forged in the trenches of France.

                    Historical Fiction and Fictional History

Much as they may deplore the fact, historians have no monopoly on the past and
no franchise as its privileged interpreters to the public. It may have been dif-
ferent once, but there can no longer be any doubt about the relegation of the h-
istorian to a back seat. Far surpassing works of history, as measured by the si-
ze of their public and the influence they exert, are the novel, works for the s-
tage, the screen, and television. It is mainly from these sources that millions
who never open a history book derive such conceptions, interpretations, convict-
ions, or fantasies as they have about the past. Whatever gives shape to popular
conceptions of the past is of concern to historians, and this surely includes f-
iction.

Broadly speaking, two types of fiction deal with the past - historical fiction
and fictional history. The more common of the two is historical fiction, which
places fictional characters and events in a more or less authentic historical b-
ackground. Examples range from _War and Peace_ to _Gone With the Wind_. Since a-
ll but a few novelists must place their fictional characters in some period, ne-
arly all fiction can be thought of as in some degree historical. But the term is
applied as a rule only to novels in which historical events figure prominently.
Fictional history, on the other hand, portrays and focuses attention upon real
historical figures and events, but with the license of the novelist to imagine
and invent. It has yet to produce anything approaching Tolstoy's masterpiece. S-
ome fictional history makes use of invented characters and events, and historic-
al fiction at times mixes up fictional and nonfictional characters. As a result
the two genres overlap sometimes, but not often enough to make the distinction
unimportant.

Of the two, it is fictional history that is the greater source of mischief, for
it is here that fabrication and fact, fiction and nonfiction, are most likely to
be mixed and confused. Of course, historians themselves sometimes mix fact with
fancy, but it is a rare one who does it consciously or deliberately, and he kno-
ws very well that if discovered he stands convicted of betraying his calling. T-
he writer of fictional history, on the other hand, does this as a matter of cou-
rse and with no compunction whatever. The production and consumption of fiction-
al history appear to be growing of late. Part of the explanation of this is pro-
bably the fragmentation of history by professionals, their retreat into special-
izations, their abandonment of the narrative style, and with it the traditional
patronage of lay readers. Fictional history has expanded to fill the gap thus c-
reated but has at the same time gone further to create a much larger readership
than history books ever had.

                      Virginia Woolf's Success and Failure

Virginia Woolf's development as a novelist was deeply influenced by her struggle
to reconcile feminism and art. Long before the aesthetic creed of Bloomsbury ca-
me into being she had learned from her father that a work of literature is no b-
etter than the morality which it is intended to express - a lesson she never fo-
rgot. Virginia Woolf was a passionate moralist, though she directed all her fer-
vor into one narrow channel. The impulse to write _Three Guineas_ possessed her
for years, "violently...persistently, pressingly, compulsorily," until she carr-
ied it into action. This moral fervor was not contained within the limits of her
tracts, nor could it have been. Feminism is implicit in her novels. The novels
are not, of course, didactic in the narrow sense of pleading for specific refor-
ms, but they illustrate the dangers of one-sidedness and celebrate the androgyn-
ous mind.

Virginia Woolf's main emphasis in her feminist writings, as in the novels, was
on self-reform, and on art as a means to that end. Novels and tracts alike grew
out of a preoccupation with her own spiritual dilemma. Fiction was the medium w-
ithin which Virginia Woolf controlled and directed this intense self-absorption.
When she deserted art for propaganda, as in _Three Guineas_, her self-abosorpti-
on got the upper hand. Thus, paradoxically, she was truer to her feminist ideas
as a novelist than as a pamphleteer. Her social conscience and her aesthetic vi-
sion were mutually dependent. She could express her feminism only by means of h-
er art; but her art owed its character to her feminism.

The contrast between Virginia Woolf's failure in _Three Guineas_ and her triumph
in _The Years_ comfirms this impression. In the first, confining herself to pol-
itical and social controversy, she lost her grasp of reality and ended up talki-
ng to herself. In the second, striving, as she said, "to give the whole of the
present society...facts as well as the vision," she transcended purely personal
preoccupations and created a lasting work of art. Viginia Woolf's direct attack
on social evil is too shrill and self-indulgent to succeed, even as propaganda.
On the other hand, her symbolic representation of the Wasteland - pollution, fa-
ithlessness, remorse - has a lucid objectivity that forces the reader to see th-
rough her eyes. The tract, with all its talk of reform, is onesided. The novel
is whole.

In Virginia Woolf's case, the myth of the artist as more or less helpless agent
of his own creative drive seems to have a foundation in fact. She needed the di-
scipline of art, because it permitted her to express her intense moral indignat-
ion, while at the same time controlling the disintegrating effects of that indi-
gnation upon her personality. Art produced feelings of release and harmony, such
as she associated with the androgynous mind. When she avoided that discipline,
as in _Three Guineas_, her writing tended to become morbid. In relation to the
radiance of Virginia Woolf's artistic successes, therefore, _Three Guineas_ rep-
resents a kind of negative definition. Through it we can glance into the heart
of her darkness.

================================================================================

                                    Meredith

With Meredith's _The Egoist_ we enter into a critical problem that we have not
yet before faced in these studies. That is the problem offered by a writer of r-
ecognizably impressive stature, whose work is informed by a muscular intelligen-
ce, whose language has splendor, whose "view of life" wins our respect, and yet
for whom we are at best able to feel only a passive appreciation which amounts,
practically, to indifference. We should be unjust to Meredith and to criticism
if we should, giving in to the inertia of indifference, simply avoid dealing wi-
th him and thus avoid the problem along with him. He does not "speak to us", we
might say; his meaning is not a "meaning for us"; he "leaves us cold". But do n-
ot the challenge and the excitement of the critical problem as such lie in that
ambivalence of attitude which allows us to recognize the intelligence and even
the splendor of Meredith's work, while, at the same time, we experience a lack
of sympathy, a failure of any enthusiasm of response?

================================================================================

                              Mendelssohn's Music

In some circles, Mendelssohn's reputation diminished rapidly after his death in
1847. By 1852, he was already regarded by many as "the object of pitying dispar-
agement". European musical audiences, newly enamored with the expansiveness of
Wagner's _Tristan and Isolde_, soon found Mendelssohn's music too restrained and
academic.

Post-Wagnerian anti-Romanticism did little to salvage the composer's standing.
Proponents of Schoenberg and his twelve-tone serialism regarded Mendelssohn as
a quaint, conservative composer who crafted superficial, "tenderly sentimental"
music.

Such "arbiters" as these have moved far too illiberally to certain conclusions.
The atmospheric, melodic beauty of the _Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream_
shows the imprint of an original mind, anticipating the orchestral achievement
of Rimsky-Korsakov. At the time of its composition, the _Octet_ displayed unexa-
mpled lightness and rhythmic effect; the impressionistic _Hebrides Overture_ in-
spired the painting of Turner. And Mendelssohn's greatest pictorial works, the
_Scottish_ and _Italian_ symphonies, constantly reveal new vistas. One of the f-
irst, great nineteenth-century Nature composers, Mendelssohn's music simply end-
ures; critics would do well to ask why.

================================================================================

                                  Mary Shelley

Mary Shelley herself was the first to point to her fortuitous immersion in the
literary and scientific revolutions of her day as the source of her novel _Fran-
kenstein_. Her extreme youth, as well as her sex, have contributed to the gener-
ally held opinion that she was not so much an author in her own right as a tran-
sparent medium through which passed the ideas of those around her. "All Mrs. Sh-
eley did," writes Mario Praz, "was to provide a passive reflection of some of t-
he wild fantasies which were living in the air about her."

Passive reflections, however, do not produce original works of literature, and
_Frankenstein_, if not a great novel, was unquestionably an original one. The m-
ajor Romantic and minior Gothic tradition to which it should have belonged was
to the literature of the overreacher: the superman who breaks through normal hu-
man limitations to defy the rules of society and infringe upon the realm of God.
In the Faust story, hypertrophy of the individual will is symbolized by a pact
with the devil. Byron's and Balzac's heroes; the Wandering Jew; the chained and
unchained Prometheus: all are overreachers, all are punished by their own exces-
ses - by a surfeit of sensation, of experience, of knowledge and, most typicall-
y, by the doom of eternal life. 

But Mary Shelley's overreacher is different. _Frankenstein_'s exploration of the
forbidden boundaries of human science does not cause the prolongation and exten-
sion of his own life, but the creation of a new one. He defies mortality not by
living forever, but by giving birth.

================================================================================

                                 Virginia Woolf

In _A Room of One's Own_, Virginia Woolf performs a typically stream-of-conscio-
usness feat by beginning with a description of the view from her window: a leaf
falls from a tree, and a woman in leather boots and a man in a maroon overcoat
climb into a taxi and glide away. Woolf uses this moment to discuss the unity of
the mind, and the effortlessness with which she had invested this ordinary sight
with a kind of rhythmic order. She ends with a consideration of Coleridge's rem-
ark that a great mind is androgynous. "What does one mean by the unity of the m-
ind?" Woolf asks.

One of Woolf's theses is that unity, and not repression, is the necessary state
for creativity. Woolf describes men's sentences as having a particular shape, n-
atural to men, but unnatural and clumsy to women. She rightly praises Austen for
developing her own rhythm and her own sentence, which is expressive of her geni-
us, her characters, and her history. Woolf suggests that the women's suffrage m-
ovement fomented a reaction of threatened male self-assertion that meant a decl-
ine in literary power. "It is fatal," she writes, "for any one who writes to th-
ink of their sex ... it is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any gri-
evance; to plead justice with any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a w-
omen."

_A Room of One's Own_ exhorts women to reach for a higher, almost religious app-
roach to writing. "Do not dream influencing other people;" she writes, "think of
things in themselves."

================================================================================

                          Virginia Woolf and Politics

The two essays in which Virginia Woolf explores women's role in art and politics
have traditionally been seen as a problematical adjunct to her novels. While _A
Room With a View_, with its acerbic wit, has been given grudging respect, the o-
utspokenly programmatic _Three Guineas_ has been dismissed as a pacifist-femini-
st tract. No doubt these essays lack the subtlety and superb control of the nov-
els, but to a recent generation of critics they remain significant because of t-
heir anticipation of many of the concerns of contemporary feminism.

_A Room of One's Own_ (1929) is written in the form of a lecture "delivered" at
a fictitious women's college. Woolf begins by contrasting the paltry luncheon g-
iven at the college with the luxurious fare offered at a nearby men's universit-
y. The difference symbolizes more profound disparities which - Woolf now comes
to her main point - bear directly on the fortunes of women artists. For the wom-
an author, financial independence, opportunities for education, tranquility, and
privacy are necessary preconditions, without which women are unlikely to produce
works of genius. Great art can never be expected from "laboring, servile, or un-
educated people". (Among modern feminists, Tillie Olsen makes a similar point in
_Silences_, though without Woolf's undertone of class condescension.) When a wo-
man obtains a room of her own, in all its senses, she may, according to Woolf,
develop what Coleridge termed "the androgynous mind", one which, having united
its "male" and "female" sides, "transcends and comprehends the feelings of both
sexes".

In _Three Guineas_ (1938) Woolf's central argument, again foreshadowing a key c-
ontention of later feminism, is that the process of changing gender restrictions
in the public world and in the private individual are interdependent. Such issu-
es as childrearing (which she felt should be a shared responsibility) and profe-
ssional equality between the sexes are not separate considerations, but rather
different aspects of the same problem. Woolf also attempts to define women's re-
sponsibilities in the larger political world. Discussing the probability of ano-
ther world war, she argues that women with jobs in manufacturing should refuse
to produce arms for use in a male-instigated debacle. Both at the time and sinc-
e, many readers have found this argument naive. One working class reader, Agnes
Smith, wrote Woolf that the book was decidedly class-bound; working women could
hardly afford to jeopardize their employment for a pacifist ideal. Current femi-
nist critics accept the validity of Smith's point - indeed they acknowledge that
it exposes a limitation of Woolf's feminism generally - but they also note that
the mild derision which greeted _Three Guineas_ from the male establishment was
typical of the reception often given a woman thinker's ideas.

================================================================================

                                     Goethe

Unlike the carefully weighted and planned compositions of Dante, Goethe's writi-
ngs have always the sense of immediacy and enthusiasm. He was a constant experi-
menter with life, with ideas, and with forms of writing. For the same reason, h-
is works seldom have the qualities of finish or formal beauty which distinguish
the masterpieces of Dante and Virgil. He came to love the beauties of classicism
but these were never an essential part of his make-up. Instead, the urgency of
the moment, the spirit of the thing, guided his pen. As a result, nearly all his
works have serious flaws of structure, of inconsistencies, of excesses and redu-
ndancies and externalities.

In the large sense, Goethe represents the fullest development of the romanticis-
t. It has been argued that he should not be so designated because he so clearly
matured and outgrew the kind of romanticism exhibited by Wordsworth, Shelley, a-
nd Keats. Shelley and Keats died young; Wordsworth lived narrowly and abandoned
his early attitudes. In contrast, Goehte lived abundantly and developed his fai-
th in the spirit, his understanding of nature and human nature, and his reliance
on feelings as man's essential motivating force. The result was an all-encompas-
sing vision of reality and a philosophy of life broader and deeper than the par-
tial visions and attitudes of other romanticists. Yet the spirit of youthfulnes-
s, the impatience with close reasoning or "logic-chopping", and the continued f-
aith in nature remained his to the end, together with an occasional waywardness
and impulsiveness and a disregard of artistic or logical propriety which savor
strongly of romantic individualism. Since so many twentieth-centry thoughts and
attitudes are similarly based on the stimulus of the Romantic Movement, Goethe
stands as particularly the poet of modern times as Dante stood for medieval tim-
es and as Shakespeare for the Renaissance.

================================================================================

                                  Jane Austen

Not a few of Jane Austen's personal acquaintances might have echoed Sir Samuel
Egerton Brydges, who noticed that "she was fair and handsome, slight and elegan-
t, but with cheeks a little too full," while "never suspect[ing] she was an aut-
horess." For this novelist whose personal obscurity was more complete than that
of any other famous writer was always quick to insist either on complete anonym-
ity or on the propriety of her limited craft, her delight in delineating just "3
or 4 Families in a Country village". With her self-deprecatory remarks about her
inability to join "strong manly, spirited sketches, full of Variety and Glow" w-
ith her "litter bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory", Jane Austen perpetuated the be-
lief among her friends that her art was just an accomplishment "by a lady", if
anything "rather too light and bright and sparkling". In this respect she resem-
bled one of her favorite contemporaries, Mary Brunton, who would rather have "g-
lid[ed] through the world unknown" than been "suspected of literary airs - to be
shunned, as literary women are, by the more pretending of their own sex, and ab-
horred, as literary women are, by the more pretending of the other! - my dear, I
would sooner exhibit as a ropedancer."

Yet, decorous though they minght first seem, Austen's self-effacing anonymity a-
nd her modest description of her miniaturist art also imply a criticism, even a
rejection, of the world at large. For, as Gaston Bachelard explains, the miniat-
ure "allows us to be world conscious at slight risk". While the creators of sat-
irically conceived diminutive landscapes seem to see everything as small because
they are themselves so grand, Austen's analogy for her art - her "little bit (t-
wo Inches wide) of Ivory" - suggests a fragility that reminds us of the risk and
instability outside the fictional space. Besides seeing her art metaphorically,
as her critics would too, in relation to female arts severely devalued until qu-
ite recently (for painting on ivory was traditionally a "ladylike" occupation),
Austen attempted through self-imposed novelistic limitations to define a secure
place, even as she seemed to admit the impossibility of actually inhabiting such
a small space with any degree of comfort. And always, for Austen, it is women b-
ecause they are too vulnerable in the world at large - who must acquiesce in th-
eir own confinement, no matter how stifling it may be.

================================================================================

                                 Dreiser's Work

Most arguments about Dreiser's work center around the question of what is the o-
verriding value in a work of art: content or form. His supporters, who included
Frank Norris, H.L.Mencken, and even Nobelist Sinclair Lewis, maintained that his
courageous truth-telling realism "cleared the trail from Victorian timidity in
American fiction to honesty, boldness, and passion of life". They argued that h-
is style, inelegant as it was, represented his subject more appropriately than
genteel aestheticism would have done.

Dreiser's antagonists, chiefly critics who embraced the New Humanism, condemned
his crude style and his choice of prosaic characters and mundane situations. Th-
ey attacked his work as vulgar because he used commonplace subjects, and immoral
because he questioned accepted values. Some of their animus can be attributed to
sharp political differences between them and the writers of so-called proletari-
an literature, like Farrell, Steinbeck, and Dos Passos. These impassioned criti-
cs deplored what they deemed the crude anti-intellectualism of the naturalists.
Others, like Kazin and Cowley, wrote about Dreiser's work as if it had emanated
without thought, care, or design, mirroring reality and only, as if by accident,
unconsciously reaching artistic heights.

The doctrinal dispute continues. The tradition, inherited by Dreiser from Defoe,
appears in added strength and new forms in recent works of Truman Capote and No-
rman Mailer. Prisoners, picketers, slum children and their like become the prot-
agonists of best-selling works, while gossamer tales of modern Brahmins are spun
by Jamesian adherents.

================================================================================

                            The Cardinal and Bosola

The curtain rises; the Cardinal and Daniel de Bosola enter from the rignt. In a-
ppearance, the Cardinal is something between an EI Greco cardinal and a Van Dyke
noble lord. He has the tall, spare form - the elongated hands and features - of
the former; the trim pointed beard, the imperial repose, the commanding authori-
ty of the latter. But the EI Greco features are not really those of asceticism
or inner mystic spirituality. They are the index to a cold, refined but ruthless
cruelty in a highly civilized controlled form. Neither is the imperial repose an
aloof mood of proud detachment. It is a refined expression of satanic pride of
place and talent.

To a degree, the Cardinal's coldness is artificially cultivated. He has defined
himself against his younger brother Duke Ferdinand and is the opposite to the o-
verwrought emotionality of the latter. But the Cardinal's aloof mood is not one
of bland detachment. It is the deliberate detachment of a methodical man who co-
llects his thoughts and emotons into the most compact and formidable shape - th-
at when he strikes, he may strike with the more efficient and devastating force.
His easy movements are those of the slowly circling eagle just before the swift
descent with exposed talons. Above all else, he is a man who never for a moment
doubts his destined authority as a governor. He derisively and sharply rebukes
his brother the Duke as easily and readily as he mocks his mistress Julia. If he
has betrayed his hireling Bosola, he uses his brother as the tool to win back h-
is "familiar". His court dress is a long brilliant scarlet cardinal's gown with
white cuffs and a white collar turned back over the red, both collar and cuffs
being elaborately scalloped and embroidered. He wears a small cape, reaching on-
ly to the elbows. His cassock is buttoned to the ground, giving a heightened ef-
fect to his already tall presence. Richelieu would have adored his neatly trimm-
ed beard. A richly jeweled and ornamented cross lies on his breast, suspended f-
rom his neck by a gold chain.

Bosola, for his part, is the Renaissance "familiar" dressed conventionally in s-
omber black with a white collar. He wears a chain about his neck, a suspended o-
rnament, and a sword. Although a "bravo", he must not be thought of as a leathe-
r-jacketed, heavy-booted tough, squat and swarthy. Still less is he a sneering,
leering, melodramatic villain of the Victorian gaslight tradition. Like his bla-
ck-and-white clothes, he is a colorful contradiction, a scholar-assassin, a hum-
anist-hangman; introverted and introspective, yet ruthless in action; moody and
reluctant, yet violent. He is a man of scholarly taste and subtle intellectual
discrimination doing the work of a hired ruffian. In general effect, his impers-
onator must achieve suppleness and subtlety of nature, a highly complex, compre-
ssed, yet well restrained intensity of temperament. Like Duke Ferdinand, he is
inwardly tormented, but not by undiluted passion. His dominant emotion is an in-
tellectualized one: that of disgust at a world filled with knavery and folly, b-
ut in which he must play a part and that a lowly, despicable one. He is the kind
of rarity that Browing loved to depict in his Renaissance monologues.

================================================================================

                                 Samuel Johnson

Many readers assume that, as a neoclassical literary critic, Samuel Johnson wou-
ld normally prefer the abstract, the formal, and the regulated to the concrete,
the natural, and the spontaneous in a work of literature. Yet any close reading
of Johnson's criticism shows that Johnson is not blind to the importance of the
immediate, vivid, specific detail in literature; rather, he would underscore the
need for the telling rather than the merely accidental detail.

In other ways, too, Johnson's critical method has much in common with that of t-
he Romantics, with whom Johnson and, indeed, the entire neoclassical tradition
are generally supposed to be in conflict. Johnson was well aware, for example,
of the sterility of literary criticism that is legalistic or pedantic, as was t-
he case with the worst products of the neoclassical school. His famous argument
against the slavish following of the "three unities" of classical drama is a go-
od example, as is his defense of the supposedly illegitimate "tragicomic" mode
of Shakespeare's latest plays. Note, in particular, the basis of that defense:
"That this is a practice contrary to the rules of criticism," Johnson wrote, "w-
ill be readily allowed; but there is always an appeal from criticism to nature."

The sentiment thus expressed could easily be endorsed by any of the Romantics,
the empiricism it exemplifies is a vital quality of Johnson's criticism, as is
the willingness to jettison "laws" of criticism when to do so makes possible a
more direct appeal to the emotions of the reader. Addison's _Cato_, highly prai-
sed in Johnson's day for its "correctness", is damned with faint praise by John-
son: "_Cato_ affords a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners,
and delivers just and noble sentiments, in diction easy, elevated, and harmonio-
us, but its hopes and fears communicate no vibration to the heart." Wordsworth
could hardly demur.

Even on the question of poetic diction, which, according to the usual interpret-
ation of Wordsworth's 1800 preface to the _Lyrical Ballads_, was the central ar-
ea of conflict between Romantic and Augustan, Johnson's views are surprisingly
"modern". In his _Life of Dryden_, he defends the use of a special diction in p-
oetry, it is true; but his reasons are all-important. For Johnson, poetic dicti-
on should serve the ends of direct emotional impact and ease of comprehension,
not those of false profundity or grandiosity. "Words too familiar," he wrote, 
"or too remote, defeat the purpose of a poet. From those sounds which we hear on
small or on coarse occasions, we do not easily receive strong impressions, or d-
elightful images; and words to which we are nearly strangers, whenever they occ-
ur, draw that attention on themselves which they should transmit to things." If
the poetic diction of the neoclassical poets, at its worst, erects needless bar-
riers between reader and meaning, that envisioned by Johnson would do just the
opposite: it would put the reader in closer contact with the "things" that are
the poem's subject.

                               Shaw's View of Art

Shaw's defense of a theater of ideas brought him up against both his great bugb-
ears - commercialized art on the one hand and Art for Art's Sake on the other.
His teaching is that beauty is a by-product of other activity; that the artist
writes out of moral passion (in forms varying from political conviction to reli-
gious zeal), not out of love of art; that the pursuit of art for its own sake is
a form of self-indulgence as bad as any other sort of sensuality. In the end, t-
he errors of "pure" art and of commercialized art are identical: they both appe-
al primarily to the senses. True art, on the other hand, is not merely a matter
of pleasure. It may be unpleasant. A favorite Shavian metaphor for the function
of the arts is that of tooth-pulling. Even if the patient is under laughing gas,
the tooth is still pulled.

The history of aesthetics affords more examples of a didactic than of a hedonic
view. But Shaw's didacticism takes an unusual turn in its application to the hi-
story of the arts. If, as Shaw holds, ideas are a most important part of a work
of art, and if, as he also holds, ideas go out of date, it follows that even the
best works of art go out of date in some important respects and that the genera-
lly held view that great works are in all respects eternal is not shared by Sha-
w. In the preface to Three plays for Puritans, he maintains that renewal in the
arts means renewal in philosophy, that the first great artist who comes along a-
fter a renewal gives to the new philosophy full and final form, that subsequent
artists, though even more gifted, can do nothing but refine upon the master wit-
hout matching him. Shaw, whose essential modesty is as disarming as his pose of
vanity is disconcerting, assigns to himself the role, not of the master, but of
the pioneer, the role of a Marlowe rather than of a Shakespeare. "The whirligig
of time will soon bring my audiences to my own point of view," he writes, "and
then the next Shakespeare that comes along will turn these petty tentatives of
mine into masterpieces final for their epoch."

"Final for their epoch" - even Shakespearean masterpieces are not final beyond
that. Not one, says Shaw, will ever write a better tragedy than Lear or a better
opera than Don Giovanni or a better music drama than Der Ring des Nibelungen; b-
ut just as essential to a play as this aesthetic merit is moral relevance which,
if we take a naturalistic and historical view of morals, it loses, or partly lo-
ses, in time. Shaw, who has the courage of his historicism, consistently withst-
ands the view that moral problems do not change, and argues therefore that for
us modern literature and music form a Bible surpassing in significance the Hebr-
ew Bible. That is Shaw's anticipatory challenge to the neo-orthodoxy of today.

                              Josquin in Obscurity

Until Josquin des Prez, 1440-1521, Western music was liturgical, designed as an
accompaniment to worship. Like the intricately carved gargoyles perched atop me-
dieval cathedrals beyond sight of any human, music was composed to please God b-
efore anybody else; its dominant theme was reverence. Emotion was there, but it
was the grief of Mary standing at the foot of the Cross, the joy of the faithful
hailing Christ's resurrection. Even the secular music of the Middle Ages was ti-
ed to predetermined patterns that sometimes seemed to stand in the way of indiv-
idual expression.

While keeping one foot firmly planted in the divine world, Josquin stepped with
the other into the human. He scored magnificent masses, but also newly expressi-
ve motets such as the lament of David over his son Absalom or the "Deploration
d'Ockeghem", a dirge on the death of Ockeghem, the greatest master before Josqu-
in, a motet written all in black notes, and one of the most profoundly moving s-
cores of the Renaissance. Josquin was the first composer to set psalms to music.
But alongside _Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino_ ("Bless the Lord, all ye w-
orks of the Lord") he put El Gillo ("The cricket is a good singer who manages l-
ong poems") and Allegez moy ("Solace me, sweet pleasant brunette"). Josquin was
praised by Martin Luther, for his music blends respect for tradition with a reb-
el's willingness to risk the horizon. When Galileo was to science, Josquin was
to music. While preserving their allegiance to God, both asserted a new importa-
nce for man.

Why then should Josquin languish in relative obscurity? The answer has to do wi-
th the separation of concept from persormance in music. In fine art, concept and
performance are one; both the art lover and the art historian have thousands of
years of paintings, drawings and sculptures to study and enjoy. Similarly with
literature: Poetry, fiction, drama, and criticism survive on the printed page or
in manuscript for judgment and admiration by succeeding generations. But musical
notation on a page is not art, no matter how lofty or excellent the composer's
conception; it is, crudely put, a set of directions for productin art. Being hi-
ghly symbolic, musical notation requires training before it can even be read, l-
et alone performed. Moreover, because the musical conventions of other days are
not ours, translation of a Renaissance score into modern notation brings diffic-
ulties of its own. For example, the REnaissance notation of Josquin's day did n-
ot designate the tempo at which the music should be played or sung. It did not
indicate all flats or sharps; these were sounded in accordance with musicianly
rules, which were capable of transforming major to minor, minor to major, diato-
nic to chromatic sound, and thus affect melody, harmony, and musical expression.
A Renaissance composition might include several parts - but it did not indicate
which were to be sung, which to be played, nor even whether instruments were to
be used at all.

Thus, Renaissance notation permits of several interpretations and an imaginative
musician may give an interpretation that is a revelation. But no matter how ima-
ginative, few modern musicians can offer any interpretation of Renaissance musi-
c. The public for it is small, limiting the number of musicians who cna afford
to learn, rehearse, and perform it. Most of those who attempt it at all are stu-
dents organized in collegia musica whose memberships have a distressing habit of
changing every semester, thus preventing directors from maintaining the year-in
year-out continuity required to achieve excellence of performance. Finally, the
instruments used in Renaissance times - drummhorns, recorders, rauschpfeifen, s-
hawms, sackbuts, organettes - must be specially procured.

                                  John A. Rein

Of several known altar paintings by John A.Rein, only one has been researched.
It is _The Last Supper_, painted in 1895 for a small country church near Roseau
in northern Minnesota. The circular arrangement of the figures and the rugged e-
pressiveness of their faces brings to mind the same subject as depicted in the
folk baroque altars of central Norway. A comparison with a more readily availab-
le model, however, tends to weaken the theory of Norwegian inspiration. In the
same edition of the Norwegina-American Bible used by the artist Lars Christenso-
n, there is an illustration of _da Vinci's Last Supper_, in which the figures h-
ave been rearranged to fit the page by cutting off those on both ends and placi-
ng them together below the center section. The result bears several striking si-
milarities to Rein's arragnement of figures. For example, the five figures in f-
ront of the table face right and look toward one figure at the end, who faces l-
eft. The Bible also includeds portraits of hte apostles drawn from da Vinci's f-
resco. Most of them reappear in easily recognizable form as the heads in Rein's
work.

Rein's _The Last Supper_ appears to be very much his own creation, freely put t-
ogether from elements in the limited art work available to him. When these sour-
ces were not sufficient for his needs, he turned to what he saw around him. The
chair in the foreground is of hte peasant empire type which was popular in the
early Norwegian settlements. The pitcher and bowl, motifs possibly introduced as
a result of confusion between the themes of the Washing of the Feet and the Last
Supper, appear to have come directly from a nineteenth-century washstand.

While the specific sources for Rein's altar painting appear to have been Americ-
an, the strong expressive color and undulating line are typical of Norwegian ar-
t. The strong impact of the work results, in part, from the organic character of
the shadow from which the figures rise and from the converging lines of the flo-
or adn ceiling which center on the figure of Christ, drawing the viewer into th-
is holy company.

The case of John Rein poses the problem of how the concept of ethnicity relates
to that of folk art. He learned the woodworker's trade in Nowway, and he may al-
so have acquired there an affinity for certain kinds of line and color; as a pa-
inter, however, he was largely self-taught. His work is distinguished as much by
those characteristics which we have come to call primitive as by those which mi-
ght be considered part of Norwegian tradition. He is, therefore, close to that
have experimented their way to a medium through which their creative needs are
fulfilled. In this art with its "private vision" and "personal universe", to qu-
ote Herbert Hemphill, Jr., there can be no ehtnicity. The word ethnicity, itsel-
f, implies an acquired set of patterns and beliefs which characterize a group.
In order to bring ethnicity into a discussion of folk art, one is forced to rec-
ognize tradition as a major element in it. There are purely self-taught artists
among the Norwegian-Americans, some of whom are of considerable interest, but t-
here is nothing intrinsically Norwegian-American in their work. Rein falls close
to these.

                                 Davie's Poetry

The poet and critic W.H. Auden once wrote, "Ther critical opinions of a writer
should always be taken with a large grain of salt. For the most part, they are
manifestations of his debate with himself as to what he should do next and what
he should avoid". While Auden denies the applicability of a poet's critical the-
ories to poetry in general, he emphasizes the usefulness of those theories as a
key to the poet's own work. In this paper, I have used the criticism of Donald
Davie as a gloss on Davie's own poetry, taking the criticism not necessarily as
an objective description of the real workings of the poetry but, as Auden mignt
suggest, as an indication of Davie's goals as poet.

Over teh twenty-odd years of Davie's career, these goals have undergone no fund-
amental change. The style of poetry Davie described as his ideal in his critical
essay _Purity of Diction in English Verse_, published in 1953, is the style Dav-
ie's own poetry still aspires to in his most recent work. The changes in Davie's
poetry over the years have been directed toward not an abandonment but a fuller
realization of the goal he envisaged in the early fifties, which he summarized
as, in Eliot's phrase, "the perfection of a common language".

Calvin Bedient, regards Davie's critical theories as wrongheaded, sees Davie's
best poetry as a tacit repudiation of those theories; Davie's finest lyrics, ac-
cording to Bedient, were written in spite of, not because of, his critical idea-
s. For Bedient, the growth of Davie's poetic skill reflects his gradual "escape"
from the influence of his own poetic ideals. But a more careful reading of Davie
suggests that, on the contrary, Davie's best poems are not ones in which he dev-
iates from his stated poetic ideals but rather those in which he comes closest
to embodying them; and this he has done with increasing frequency in his recent
work.

The canons of Davie's cricitism are basically four:

(1) Poetry should be "pure" in diction, which involves, primarily, economy and
restraint in the use of metaphor. The poet, according to Davie, is concerned wi-
th "purifying" as well as "expending" the language; that is, not only must he c-
oin new ways of seeing the world (new metaphors and images), but he must also p-
reserve and refurbish the old ways. Good poetry does this through the use of rh-
ythm and sound and through vivid, specific nouns and verbs that help to revivify
the meaning buried in dead metaphors and images.

(2) Poetry should adhere closely to the twin models of, on the one hand, "prose
and careful conversation", and on the other, the usages of the great poets of t-
he past. The poet must be chary of drastic innovation without a strong reason.

(3) Poetry should use, as far as possible, the syntax of ordinary language.

(4) Poetry should handle its meanings as clearly and explicitly as possible, dr-
awing distinctions that are at once subtle and lucid. Poetry should be intellig-
ent as well as passionate.

Davie makes it clear that poetry that follows these conons may not be the only
real poetry, or evern the best poetry; as he points out, this kind of "prosaic
strength" is most characteristic not of great poets but of good ones, and Davie
lists Gower, Greville, Denham, Goldsmith, Johnson, and Cowper as examples. But
it is this company of solid, intelligible, honest poets that Davie aspires to j-
oin, and it is by their standards that we must accordingly judge Davie's work.

                         Dickens and David Copperfield

When completing _David Copperfield_, Dickens experienced a powerful aftereffect
that fleft him confused about "whether to laugh or to cry ... strangely devided
... between sorrow and joy". He felt that he had been turned inside out, his in-
ner life now visible, in partly disguised forms, in the shadowy world of ordina-
ry daylight. The story he had written was so deeply personal that "no one can b-
elieve [it] in the reading, more than I have believed it in the writing". Haing
transformed his private memories and his emotional life into a public myth about
himself, particularly his development from an abandoned child into a great popu-
lar artist surrounded by love and success, he felt the excitement both of expos-
ure and catharsis. Exorcising the sounds of childhood and young adulthood, he a-
lso dramatized the unresolved problems of his personality and his marriage, ant-
icipating the turmoil that was to come. Though energized by the process of writ-
ing, he was also exhausted by "heaps of Copperfieldian blots", by that "tremend-
ous paroxysm of Copperfield". Towards the end, he felt "rigid with Copperfield
... from head to foot". When he finally put down his pen in October 1850, he to-
ok up his " idea of wandering somewhere for a day or two". Almost inevitably, he
went back "to Rochester ... where I was a small boy".

In _David Copperfield_ he re-created in mythic terms his relationship with his
mother, his father, his siblings, particularly Fanny, and with his wife and his
wift's sisters. The novel was more precious to him than his own children because
the favorite child was himself. Soon after beginning, he confessed that he had
stuck to that fictional name through the exploration of alternative titles beca-
use he had, even at the earliest stage, recognized that he was writing a book a-
bout himself.

His passion for names also expressed his need to pattern and control. After the
birth of Katie in 1839, he assumed the right to name all his children (Catherine
had "little or nothing to say" about that). The elaborate christening of Alfred
D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens provides the representative example of the novelist im-
posing his literary constructs on other people's lives as well as his own. When
it came to his family, he did not admit of any distinction. When it came to his
novels, the distinction between self and other was subordinated to the dramatiz-
ation of the many varieties of the single self. Changing Charles Dickens into D-
avid Copperfield had the force both of unconscious reversal and of minimal auto-
biographical distancing. At the heart of the novel was a partly mediated version
of himself that represented his effort to claim that he had come through, that
all was well with him as he approached the age of forty.

================================================================================

                              Alain Robbe-Grillet

Alain Robbe-Grillet is not as cerebral a writer as Nathalie Sarraute or Michel
Butor. But he has been more popular, particularly in America. Perhaps that is o-
ne reason. There are other. He relies even more heavily than his fellow novelis-
ts on the roman policier for basic structure, and detective stories have a built
-in pupular fascination. Most of his characters, so far as we can determine, se-
em to be psycho-pathological. He is therefore a kind of Alfred Hitchcock of the
novel. He has also devoted himself to film writing and film making in associati-
on with the Nouvele Vague. His cinema-novels as he called them, rather than film
scripts, _Lannee Derniere a marienbad_ (1961) and _L'Immortelle_ (1963), have c-
ertainly brought him a wider public exposure than would have been possible with
the novels alone. Furthermore his novels have had wide paperback distribution in
English translation. But he is an authenti New Novelist and therefore disturbing
but not easy. He is reported to have said that he wants his reader to feel disa-
ppointed (in their expectation of clarification, presumably), that if they feel
disappointed he knows he has succeeded in what he was trying to do. At least one
critic has placed Robbe-Grillet at "the most advanced point of evolution of the
twentieth-century novel and film".

He first turned to the cinema in collaboration with the film director Alain Res-
nais. In 1961 _L'Annee Derniere a Marienbad_ hit the movie world with an origin-
ality that for a time usurped the attention customarily given to the Italian fi-
lm of Fillini or the Swedish films of Bergman. _Last Year at Marienbad_ played
long tuns in the art film houses in New York and across the United States. Bruce
Morrissette in a critique of the film pointed out to less perceptive critics th-
at it represented a continuation of techniques established in the earlier novel-
s: "False scenes and objectified hypothesis as in "The Voyeur_, a subjective un-
iverse converted into objective perceptions as in _Jealousy_ - with its detempo-
ralization of mental states, its mixture of memories (true and false), of desire
images adn affective projections - the dissolves' found in _The Labyrinth_: all
these reach a high point in _Marienbad_ ... The spectator's work, like that of
the reader, becomes an integral part of the cinematic or novelistic creation".
The viewer like the reader was expected to collaborate in creating meaning. Mar-
ienbad takes place at an ornate Bavarian palace; the action is circular beginni-
ng with "Once more" as the camera moves through Freudian corridors, empty rooms
and a formal garden (with a return at the end); characters emerge as a young wo-
man, A, and older man, M (presumably her jealous husband), and a persistent lov-
er, X. Fantasies of seduction, resistance, desire, fear, rape, and even murder
are projected; but whose they are, A's or M's or X's, is never clear. You take
your choice.

================================================================================

                           Consistency in African Art

When you first saw a piece of African art, it impressed you as a unit; you did
not see it as a collection of shapes or forms. This, of course, means that the
shapes and volumes within the sculpture itself were coordinated so successfully
that the viewer was affected emotionally.

It is entirely valid to ask how, from a purely artistic point of view, this uni-
ty was achieved. And we must also inquire whether there is a recurrent pattern
or rules or a plastic language and vocabulary which is responsible for the powe-
rful communication of emotion which the best African sculpture achieves. If the-
re is such a pattern or rules, are these rules applied consciously or instincti-
vely ot obtain so many works of such high artistic quality?

It is obvious from the study or art history that an intense and unified emotion-
al experience, such as the Christian credo of the Byzantine or 12th or 13th cen-
tury Europe, when expressed in art forms, gave great unity, coherence, and power
to art. But such an integrated feeling was only the inspirational element for t-
he artist, only the starting point of the creative act. The expression of this
emotion and its realization in the work could be done only with discipline and
thorough knowledgeof the craft. And the African sculptor was a highly trained w-
orkman. He started his apprenticeship with a master whtn a child, and he learned
the tribal styles and the use of tools and the nature of woods so thoroughly th-
at his carving became what Boas calls "motor action" he carved automativally and
instinctively.

The African carver followed his rules without thinking of them; indeed, they ne-
ver seem to have been formulated in words. But such rules existed, for accident
and coincidence cannot explain the common plastic language of African sculpture.
There is too great a consistency from on work to another. Yet, although the Afr-
ican, with amazing insight into art, used these rules, I am certain that he was
not conscious of them. This is the great mystery of such a traditional art: tal-
ent, or the ability certain people have, without conscious effort, to follow the
rules which later the analyst can discover only from the work of art which has
already been created.

================================================================================

                               Art of Middle Ages

In the art of the Middle Ages, we never encounter the personality of the artist
as an individula; arther it is diffused through the artistic genius of centuries
embodied in th4e rules of religious art. Art of the Middle Ages is first a sacr-
ed script, the symbols and meanings of which were well settled. The circular ha-
lo placed vertically behind the head signifies sainthood, while the halo impres-
sed with a cross signifies divinity. By bare feet, we recognize God, the angels,
Jesus Christ and the apostles, but for an artist to have depicted the Virgin Ma-
ry with bare feet would have been tantamount to heresy. Several concentric, wavy
lines represent the sky, whild parallel lines water or the sea. A tree, which is
to say a single stalk with two or three stylized leaves, informs us that the sc-
ene is laid on earth. A tower with a window indicates a village, and, should an
angel be wathching from the battlements, that city is thereby identified as Jer-
usalem. Saint Peter is always depicted with curly hair, a short beard, and a to-
nsure, shile Saint Paul has always a bald head and a long beard.

A second characteristic of this iconography is obedience to a sacred mathematic-
s. "The Divine Wisdom", wrote Saint Augustine, "reveals itself everywhere in nu-
mbers", a doctrine attributable to the neo-Platonists who revived the genius of
Pythagoras. Twelve is the master number of the Church and is the product of thr-
ee, the number of the Trinity, and four, the number of material elements. The n-
umber sever, the most mysterious of all numbers, is the sum of four and three.
There are the seven ages of man, seven virtues, seven planets. In the final ana-
lysis, hte seven-tone scale of Gregorian music is the sensible embodiment of the
order of the universe. Numbers require also a symmetry. At Charters, a stained
glass window show the four prophets, Isaac, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Jeremiah, carr-
ying on their shoulders the four evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

A third characteristic of this art is to be a symbolic language, showing us one
thing and inviting us to see another. In this respect, the artist was called up-
on to imitate God, who had hidden a profound meaning behind the literal and wis-
hed nature itself to be a moral lesson to man. Thus, every painting is an alleg-
ory. In a scene of hte final judgment, we see the foolish virgins at the left h-
and of Jesus and the wise at his right, and we understand that this symbolizes
those who are lost and those who are saved. Even seemingly insignificant details
carry hidden meaning: The lion in a stained glass window is the figure of the R-
esurrection.

These, then, are the defining characteristics of the art of the Middle Ages, a
system within which even the most mediocre talent was elevated by the genius of
the centuries. The artists of the early Renaissance broke with tradition at the-
ir own peril. When they are not outstanding, they are scarcely able to avoid in-
significance and banality in their religious works, and, even when they are gre-
at, they are no more than the equals of the old masters who passively followed
the sacred rules.

================================================================================

                                  African Art

Afican art could have been ovserved and collected by Europeans no earlier than
the second half of the fifteenth century. Before that time Europe knew of Africa
only through the writing of classical authors such as Pliny and Herodotus and t-
he reports of a few Arabic travelers. Unfortunately, until the latter years of
the nineteenth century Europe was little interested in the arts of Africa except
as curiosities adn souvenirs of exotic peoples. Indeed, wiht the growth of the
slave trade, colonial exploitation, and Christian missionizing the arts were pr-
esented as evidence of the low state of heathen savagery of the African, justif-
ying both exploitation and missionary zeal. Even with the early growth of the d-
iscipline of anthropology the assumption was that Africa was a continent of sav-
ages, low on the scale of evolutionary development, and that these savages, bec-
ause they were "preliterate", would, by definition, have no history and no gove-
rnment worth notice.

In recent years the development of critical studies of oral traditions, of acco-
unts by Islamic travelers of the great Sudanese kingdoms, of the descriptions of
the coast by early European travelers, and - above all - of the concept of cult-
ural relativism, has led to a far more realistic assessment of the African, his
culture, history, and arts.

Cultural relativism is, in essence, the attitude whereby cultures other than on-
e's own are viesed in their terms and on their merits. As an alternative to the
prejudgmetn of missionaries and colonials it allows us ot view the cultures and
arts of the African without the necessity of judging his beliefs and actions ag-
ainst a Judeo-Christian moralistic base, or his art against a Greco-Renaissance
yardstick.

Curiously, the "disvovery" and enthusiasm for African art early in this century
was not based on an objective, scientific assessment but rather resulted from an
excess of romantic rebellion at the end of the last century against the Classic-
al and Naturalist toots of Western art. Unfortunately this uncritical adulation
swept aside many rational concerns to focus upon African sculpture as if it were
the product of a romantic, rebellious, fin de siecle, European movement. Obviou-
sly, African art is neither anti-classical nor anti-naturalistic: to be either
it would have had to have had its roots in Classicism or in Naturalism, both Eu-
ropean in origin. Nor was the concept of rebellion a part of the heritage of art
in sub-Saharan Africa; rather, as we shall see, it was an art conservative in i-
mpulse adn stable in concept.

We may admire these sculptures from a purely twentieth century esthetic, but if
we so limit our admiration we will most certainly fail to understand them in the
context of their appearance as documents of African thought and action.

In sharp contrast to the arts of the recent past in the Western world, by far t-
he greatest part, in fact nearly all of the art of history of the world, includ-
ing traditional Africa, was positive in its orientation; that is, it conformed
in style and meaning to the expectations - the norms - of its patrons and audie-
nce. Those norms were shared by nearly all members of the society; thus, the ar-
ts were conservative and conformist. However, it must be stressed that they were
not merely passive reflections, for they contributed actively to the sense of w-
ell-being of the parent culture. Indeed, the perishable nature of wood - the do-
minant medium for sculpture-ensured that each generation reaffirmed its faith by
re-creating its arts.

How buildings are depicted indicates how they are perceived. To the serious tra-
velers of hte eighteenth century, like James Start and Nicholas Revert who took
it upon themselves to record the legendary remains of Greece for the first time
since antiquity, there are two modes of perceptions: the topical and the archae-
ological. To introduce each monument, they resorted to the picturesque tableau.
They show the Parthenon at the time of their visit in 1751, when Athens was a s-
leepy provincial town within the Ottoman Empire and the Akropolis served as the
headquarters for the turkish governor. The temple stands in a random cluster of
modest houses; in it we can see a Turk on horseback and, through the colonnade,
the vaulted forms of the small Byzantine church that rose within the body of the
temple during the Middle Ages. This is what the Parthenon looks like today, the
authors are saying; and this depiction carries at once the quaint appeal of an
exotic land and that sense of the vanity of things which comes over us at the s-
ight of the sad dilapidation of one-time splendors.

But when they turn from romance to archaeology, the task of showing the Parthen-
on not as it is now but as it was then, Stuart and Revert restrict themselves to
the measured drawing. They re-create, in immaculate engravings of sharp clear l-
ines, the original design of the temple in suitably reduced scale and with a ca-
reful tally of dimensions. We are confronted again with the traditional abstrac-
tions of the architect's trade. Indeed, those architects who, in subsequent dec-
ades, wished to imitate the Parthenon as a venerable form of rich associational
value could do so readily from these precise plates of Stuart and Revert, witho-
ut once having seen Athens for themselves. In nineteenth century Philadelphia,
for example, the disembodied facade of the Parthenon is reconstructed as the Se-
cond Bank of the United States in an urban milieu that is completely alien to t-
he setting of the prototype.

Against the engravings of Stuart and Revert, we might pit two pencil sketches of
the Acropolis made by Le Corbusier during his apprenticeship travels in the ear-
ly years of this century. The close-up view is neither picturesque nor archaeol-
ogical. It does not show us the ubiquitous tourists scrambling over the site, f-
or example, nor any other transient feature of local relevance. Nor is the sket-
ch a reproducible paradigm of the essential design of the Parthenon. Instead, we
see the temple the way Le Corbusier experienced it, climbing toward it up the s-
teep west slope of this natural citadel, and catching sight of it at a dynamic
angle through the inner colonnade of the Propylaea, the ceremonial gate of the
Akropolis. The long view show the building in relation to the larger shapes of
nature that complement its form: the pedestal of the Akropolis spur that lifts
it up like a piece of sculpture and the Attic mountain chain on the horizon whi-
ch echoes its mass. And when Le Corbusier draws on this experience later in his
own work, it is the memory of the building as foil to nature that guides his vi-
sion.

================================================================================

                              Movies and Politics

Moviemakers have always been interested in politicians, and vice-versa. As early
in 1912, Raoul Walsh followed Pancho Villa around, filming his ambushes and exe-
cutions. In Russian, Sergei Eisenstein made several films at Stalin's request,
including _Alexander Nevski_ in 1928 and _Ivan the Terrible_ in 1945, both of w-
hich made the new regime appear to be the heir of a glorious revolutionary trad-
ition. Hitler himself charged Leni Riefenstahl to film the Nazi rallies at Nure-
mberg in 1934. The result was the _Triumph of will_, which took two years to ma-
ke and included oceans of swastika flags, miles of military parades, stylized e-
agles, rolling drums, and an omnipresent Hitler whose profile stood out against
the sky.

But the movies soon helped create a political style less stridently heroic and
melodramatic than that inspired by the theater and opera. At the beginning, of
course, early cinema techniques encouraged the leader to pantomime heavily with
excessive gestures adn expressions. The result was similar to expressionist the-
ater. But it soon became clear the cinema offered possibilities unknown on the
stage: for example, the close-up, which abolished the distance between the actor
and the audience and made exaggerated gestures unnecessary. With the actor's im-
age enlarged on the screen, even a trembling of the lips or batting the eyelids
would be magnified. When the talkies appeared, the theatrical delivery of lines
was no longer the rule. A conversational tone - even a whisper - was easily hea-
rd by the audience, making actors adopt a more natural style.

Political leaders have adapted their style to this evolution of the dramatic ar-
ts. The hero leader necessarily has a style more suited to the theater or silent
movies and is less able to use the new tone required by cinema and television,
which is more sober, allusive, and elliptical. In this sense, de Gaulle was of
the theater generation while Giscard d'Estaing belongs to the cinema and televi-
sion generation that understands the need for a more nuanced "stage presence".

Another result of the cinema has been to make actors more influential as models
to imitate, since they are so much more visible. From 1920 to 1932, stars were
inaccessible, marmoreal, and inimitable. They were idols, surrounded by an aura
of myth. In short, they were the cinema equibalent of the hero leader. During t-
he 1930s and 1940s, the star became more human. He or she, though still shining
brightly, was less exceptional, a bit more like the rest of us. The star became
a model that could be imitated - like the charm leader.

And finally in the 1950s and after, stars became virtually the reflection of the
spectator if not, indeed, his double. It became more difficult to imitate a sta-
r, since he or she was already like everyone else. This corresponded to the pol-
itical Mr. Everyman.

================================================================================

                                   Hypotheses

In science as elsewhere, we meet the assumptions of convenience and expedience,
such as equations that assme frictionless machines or chemicals in a pure state.
But by far the most important function of language in the development of scient-
ific understanding and control of the world about us is the use of a kind of as-
sumption called hypothesis at first, theory in a more developed state, and law
when its implications have been extensively corroborated. A hypothesis resembles
other assumptions in that it may be either true or false and may be used as the
premise of rational action; otherwise it differs radically as to function and p-
urpose. Hypotheses are employed experimentally in the search for truth. Without
them the so-called scientific method is not possible. The reason for this is not
always readily grasped and will now be illustrated in some detail.

Suppose, for example, that you are about to prepare an account of some fairly c-
omplex subject, such as the history of marriage. As soon as you have arrived at
a clear working definition of your topic, you begin the collection of data. Now
a datum is an item of some sort regarded as relevant to your problem. But every-
thing is in some way related to everything else, and since you cannot possible
consider all the facts related to marriage, you must limit the field of relevan-
ce in some practical, arbitrary manner. Let us assume that you are at work on t-
he status of marriage in modern urban society; perhaps you may attempt to disco-
ver to what extent the institution persists because it is biologically useful,
economically expedient, socially convenient, religiously compulsory, or merely
psychologically traditional. To proceed thus is to set up a fivefold hypothesis
that enables you to gather from the innumerable items cast up by the sea of exp-
erience upon the shores of your observation only the limited number of relevant
data - relevant, that is, to one or more of the five factors of your hypothesis.
The hypothesis (the reference of the symbol hypothesis) is like a light by means
of which we search for truth; but it is a colored light that may render invisib-
le the very object we seek. That is why, after a fair trial, we must not hesita-
te to abandon one color for another. When our hypothesis possesses the proper c-
olor and intensity, it will reveal some of the facts as data, which may then be
further studied and verified as signs of truth.

As the evidence in favor of a hypothesis (the thing again, not the word) accumu-
lates to a convincing degree, we frequently symbolize the fact with term theory.
Thus, semantically, a theory is the name of a hypothesis that has outgrown its
experimental short pants. With Charles Darwin, biological evolution was a hypot-
hesis; in contemporary science it is a theory that no rational observer, however
cautious, hesitates to accept.

When predictions based on hte implications of a theory are continually borne out
by observation, the relation symbolized is still further elevated to the status
of a law or natural law. The abstraction "law" is a dangerous one to employ bec-
ause it implies that the mind has finally arrived at the truth, ultimate and et-
ernal. Thus, the eyes of science become myopic and lose the power to discover o-
ld errors and discern new truths.

                               Bacon's of Studies

An essay which appeals chiefly ot the intellect is Francis Bacon's _Of Studies_.
His careful tripartite division of studies expressed succinctly in aphoristic p-
rose demands the complete attention of the mind of the reader. He considers stu-
dies as they should be : for pleasure, for self-improvement, for business. He c-
onsiders the evils of excess study: laziness, affectation, and preciosity. Bacon
divides books into three categories: those to be read in part, those to be read
cursorily, and those to be read with care. Studies should include reading, which
gives depth; speaking, which adds readiness of thought; and writing, which trai-
ns in preciseness. Somewhat mistakenly, the author ascribes certain virtues to
individual fields of study: wisdom to history, wit to poetry, subtlety to mathe-
matics, and depth to natural philosophy. Bacon's four-hundred-word essay, studd-
ed with Latin phrases and highly compressed in thought, has intellectual appeal
indeed.

================================================================================

                            Importance of Knowledge

For me, scientific knowledge is divided into mathematical sciences, natural sci-
ences or sciences dealing with the natural world (physical and biological scien-
ces), and sciences dealing with mankind (psychology, sociology, all the sciences
of cultural achievements, every kind of historical knowledge). Apart from these
sciences is philosophy, about which we will talk shortly. In the first place, a-
ll this is pure or theoretical knowledge, sought only for the purpose of unders-
tanding, in order to fulfill the need to understand that is intrinsic and consu-
bstantial to man. What distinguishes man from animal is that he hnows and needs
to know. If man did not know that the world existed, and that the world was of
a certain kind, that he was in the world and that he himself was of a certain k-
ind, he wouldn't be man. The technical aspects of applications of knowledge are
equally necessary for man and are of the greatest importance, because they also
contribute to defining him as man and permit him to pursue a life increasingly
more truly human.

But even while enjoying the results of technical progress, he must defend the p-
rimacy and autonomy of pure knowledge. Knowledge sought directly for its practi-
cal applications will have immediate and foreseeable success, but not the kind
of important result whose revolutionary scope is in large part unforeseen, exce-
pt by the imagination of the Utopians. Let me recall a well-known example. If t-
he Greek mathematicians had not applied themselves to the investigation of conic
sections, zealously and without the least suspicion that it might someday be us-
eful, it would not have been possible centuries later to navigate far from shor-
e. The first men to study the nature of electricity could not imagine that their
experiments, carried on because of mere intellectual curiosity, would eventually
lead to modern electrical technology, without which we can scarcely conceive of
contemporary life. Pure knowledge is valuable for its own sake, because the hum-
an spirit cannot resign itself to ignorance. But, in addition, it is the founda-
tion for practical results that would not have been reached if this knowledge h-
ad not been sought disinterestedly.

================================================================================

                              Germania of Tacitus

For the classical scholar, the Germania of Tacitus is a minor work, forming with
the Agricola a kind of prelude to the great works of Tacitus, the Annals and Hi-
stories. However, for the student of the Germanic people, Tacitus' ethnographic
treatise is a major source of information, mainly reliable, about the German tr-
ibes of the first century A.D.

Studies of Tactics have often attempted to clarify the author's purpose in writ-
ing the Germania by defining it as an example of a particular literary genre. A
few have seen the book primarily as a satire of Roman corruption, which uses the
warlike but upright Germans as a stick with which to beat the degeneracy and vi-
ce Tacitus observed in his contemporary Rome; others classify the book as an ex-
tended political pamphlet whose central purpose is to urge the emperor Trajan to
some decisive Roman action, possibly invasion, to destroy the growing threat po-
sed by the German tribes.

Both these themes are present in the Germania, but they are not central to its
purpose; if they were, Tacitus would certainly have made them more prominent and
explicit. The book's real purpose is the obvious one - to explain as fully as p-
ossible to a Roman audience what was known of the customs and character of a si-
gnificant neighboring people. In this task, Tacitus was following the examples
of several earlier ethnographers, including Livy, whose histories included an e-
thnographic study of the German people, and Seneca, who wrote lost works about
the people of India and Egypt that may well have resembled the Germania. Such w-
orks formed the type to which the Germania belongs, and though most of the exam-
ples are lost, it seems to have been a recognized genre of the period.

However, as with most ethnographic studies to this day, the Germania reveals as
much about the preoccupations of the society to which its author belonged as ab-
out the people who are the work's ostensible subject. Thus, the fear of a German
threat to the security of Rome is reflected in the largely military orientation
of the study. The picture Tacitus paints is of a thoroughly warlike people, a n-
ation of men who will "transact no business, public or private, without being a-
rmed", a society that regards weapons as "the equivalent of the man's toga with
us" - that is, the Romans - "the first distinction publicly conferred upon a yo-
uth, who now ceases to rank merely as a member of a household and becomes a cit-
izen". The Germans even applaud in assembly, not by clapping, but by clashing t-
heir spears. If Tacitus' aim was to arouse the concern of his audience over a G-
erman military threat, his choice of details surely advanced his purpose.

================================================================================

                                    Thinking

No one can be a great thinker who does not realize that as a thinker it is her
first duty to follow her intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth g-
ains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and preparation, thinks
for herself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they
do not suffer themselves to think. Not that it is solely, or chiefly, ot form g-
reat thinkers that freedom of thinking is required. On the contrary, it is as m-
uch or even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the men-
tal stature which they are capable of. There have been, and may again be, great
individual thinkers in a general atmosphere of mental slavery. But there never
has been, nor ever will be, in that atmosphere an intellectually active people.
Where any people has made a temporary approach to such a character, it has been
because the dread of heterodox speculation was for a time suspended. Where there
is a tacit convention that principles are not to be disputed; where the discuss-
ion of the greatest questions which can occupy humanity is considered to be clo-
sed, we cannot hope to find that generally high scale of mental activity which
has made some periods of history so remarkable. Never when controversy avoided
the subjects which are large and important enough to kindle enthusiasm was the
mind of a people stirred up from its foundations and the impulse given which ra-
ised even persons of the most ordinary intellect to something of the dignity of
thinking beings.

She who knows only her own side of the case knows little of that. Her reasons m-
ay be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if she is equally
unable to refute the reasons of the opposite side; if she does not so much as k-
now what they are, she has no ground for preferring either opinion. The rational
position for her would be suspension of judgment, and unless she contents herse-
lf with that, she is either led by authority, or adopts, like the generality of
the world, the side to which she feels the most inclination. Nor is it enough t-
hat she should hear the arguments of adversaries from her own teachers, present-
ed as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That
is not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them into real contact
with her own mind. She must be able to hear them from persons who actually beli-
eve them; who defend them in earnest, and do their very utmost for them. She mu-
st know them in their most plausible and persuasive form: she must feel the who-
le force of the difficulty which the true view of the subject has to encounter
and dispose of; else she will never really possess herself of the portion of tr-
uth which meets adn removes that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a hundred of what a-
re called educated persons are in this condition; even of those who can argue f-
luently for their opinions. Their conclusion may be true, but it might be false
for anything they know: they have never thrown themselves into the mental posit-
ion of those who think differently from them and considered what such persons m-
ay have to say; and consequently they do not, in any proper sense of the word,
know the doctrines which they themselves profess. They do not know those parts
of the doctrine which explain and justify the remainder; the considerations whi-
ch show that a fact which seemingly conflicts with another is reconcilable with
it, or that, of two apparently strong reasons, one and not the other ought to be
preferred.

================================================================================

                                 The Poltheist

A polytheist always has favorites among the gods, determined by his own tempera-
ment, age, and condition, as well as his own interest, temporary or permanent.
If it is true that everybody loves a lover, then Venus will be a popular deity
with all. But from lovers she will eicit special devotion. In ancient Rome, when
a young couple went out together to see a procession or other show, they would
of course pay great respect to Venus, when her image appeared on the screen. In-
stead of saying, "Isn't love wonderful?" they would say, "Great are thou, O Ven-
us." In a polytheistic society you could tell a good deal about a person's frame
of mind by the gods he favored, so that to tell a girl you were trying to woo t-
hat you thought Venus overrated was hardly the way to win her heart. But in any
case, a lovesick youth or maiden would be spontaneously supplicating Venus.

The Greeks liked to present their deities in human form; it was natural to them
to symbolize the gods as human beings glorifiecd, idealized. But this fact is a-
lso capable of misleading us. We might suppose that the ancients were really wo-
rshipping only themselves; that they were, like Narcissus, beholding their own
image in a pool, so that their worship was _anthropocentric_ (man-centered) rat-
her than _theocentric_ (god-centered). We are in danger of assuming that they w-
ere simply construction the god in their own image. This is not necessarily so.
The gods must always be symbolized in one form or another. To give them a human
form is one way of doing this, technically called _anthropomorphism_ (from the
Gree _anthropos_, a man, and _mophe_, form). People of certain temperaments and
within certain types of culture seem to be more inclined to it than are others.
It is, however, more noticeable in others than in oneself, and those who affect
to despise it are sometimes conspicuous for their addiction to it. A German onc-
e said an Englishman's idea of God is an Englishmen twelve feet tall. Such disp-
aragement of anthropomorphism occurred in the ancient world, too. The Celts, for
instance, despised Greek practice in this matter, preferring to us animals and
other such symbols. The Egyptians favored more abstract and stylized symbols, a-
mong which a well-known example is the solar disk, a symbol of _Ra_, the sun-go-
d.

Professor C.S.Lewis tells of an Oxford undergraduate he knew tho, priggishly de-
spising the conventional images of God, thought he was overcoming anghropomorph-
ism by thinking of the Deity as infinite vapor or smoke. Of course even the bea-
rded-old-man image can be a better symbol of Deity than ever could be the image,
even if this were psychologically possible, of unlimited smong.

What is really characteristic of all polytheism, however, is not the worship of
idols or humanity or forests or stars; it is, rather, the worship of innumerable
powers that confront and affect us. The powers are held to be valuable in thems-
elves; that is why they are to be worshipped. But the values conflict. The gods
do not cooperaate, so you have to play them off against each other. Suppose you
want rain. You know of two gods, the dry-god who sends drought and the wet-god
who sends rain. You do not suppose that you can just pray to the wet-god to get
busy, and simply ignore the dry-god. If you do so, the latter may be offended,
so that no matter how hard the wet-god tries to oblige you, the dry-god will do
his best to wither everything. Because both gods are powerful you must take into
consideration, begging the wet-god to be gererous and beseeching the dry-god to
stay his hand.

================================================================================

                               Bible and Theatre

Morally and culturally, American society, as reflected in our TV programs, our
theatrical fare, our literature and art appears to have hit bottom.

Gen. David Sarnoff felt prompted to issue a statement in defense of the TV indu-
stry. He pointed out that there was much good in its programs that was being ov-
erlooked while its occasional derelictions were being overly stressed. It struck
me that what he was saying about TV applied to other aspects of American culture
as well, particularly to the theatrical productions.

Without necessarily resting on his conviction that the good outweighed the bad
in American cultural activity, I saw further implications in Gen. Sarnoff's dec-
laration. Audiences needed to be sensitized more and more to the positive quali-
ties of the entertainment and cultural media. In addition, through such increas-
ed public sensitivity, producers would be encouraged to provide ever more of the
fine, and less of the sordid.

Here is where questions arise. If the exemplary aspects of TV are not being rec-
ognized, what is the reason for such a lack of appreciation? Similarly, and fur-
ther, if the theatre, including in this term the legitimate stage, on and off B-
roadway as well as the moving pictures, has large measures of goodness, truth a-
nd beauty which are unappreciated, how are we to change this situation?

All in all, what should be done to encourage and condone the good, and to disco-
urage and condemn the unsavory in the American cultural pattern?

These are serious and pressing questions - serious for the survival of hte Amer-
ican Way of Life, and pressing for immediate and adequate answers. Indeed the s-
imple truth is that the face that American shows the world affects seriously the
future of democracy all over the globe.

Since the theatre in its broadest sense is a large aspect of American culture -
its expression as well as its creation - I saw the urgent importance of bringi-
ng the worthwhile elements in the American Theatre to the fore. Especially was
this importance impressed on me when I realized how much Hollywood was involved
in exporting American life to the world, and how much Broadway with all its the-
atres means to the modern drama.

Then the thought of the Bible came to me in this connection. Was not the Bible
the basis of Western civilization as far as morals are concerned? Why not use t-
he Bible as guide and toughstone, as direction and goal in the matter of the cu-
ltral achievements of Western society? Thus was born "The Bible on Broadway."

The birth of the idea accomplished, rearing it brought the usual difficulties of
raising a child - albeit in this case a "brain" one. There was first the fact t-
hat the Bible, although the world's best seller, is not the world's best read b-
ook. Second was the current impression that "messageplays" must necessarily be
dull and unpopular...

Still, I was drawn to the project of a series of lectures on the Bible and the
contemporary theatre. What if hte Bible is not well known? Teach it! Plays with
a message dull? All plays by reason of their being works of art have been creat-
ed by their authors' selection and ordering of experience. As such, plays are p-
roponents of ideas - and certainly they are not meant to be uninteresting...

That there are spiritual, even religious ideas, in the contemporary theatre sho-
uld be no cause for wonderment. It is well known that the drama had its origin
in religion. The Greeks, the Romans, as well as the early Hebrews, all had forms
of the drama which among the first two developed into our classical plays.

In the Middle-Ages, it was the Church in hte Western World that produced the mo-
rality and mystery plays. With such a long history it is not surprising to find
and affinity between the Bible and the Theatre.

                        Philosophy Fallen on Hard Times

Although the number of journals has never been greater and the flyers announcing
new conferences, colloquia, and societies never as ambitious, it is no secret t-
hat something is wrong with philosophy in the English-speaking world. The advan-
ces made by Russell, Whitehead, Wittgenstein, and Husserl are now studied by hi-
storians, and the boldness which characterized their age, roughly from 1900 to
1950, has given way to a spirit of caution, qualification, and retreat. This is
not to say that talented people no longer study philosophy, nor that worthwhile
contributions have ceased. promising work is being done, but too often it is ov-
erwhelmed by pettifogging or left to die in obscurity.

Those unaware of what is happening in philosophy today may be surprised to learn
that few academic philosophers address the sort of problems one studied in coll-
ege: death, the existence of God, the cardinal virtues, the external world, or
the prospects for happiness. Instead, if one walks into a classroom or lecture
hall, one is likely to find brief discussions dealing with an old assortment of
issues about such things as time machines, adverbs, pains, possible worlds, sex-
ual perversion. Even the language has changed. In many cases, English prose has
been replaced by codes, symbols, and dialects incomprehensible to those outside
the profession and not much better known to some of those inside.

It is not altogether surprising that philosophy has fallen on hard times. Throu-
ghout much of this century, people believed that philosophical questions were t-
he result of logical or linguistic confusions. The task of philosophy was to el-
iminate them and thereby do away with itself...

The problem is that philosophy is unique among academic disciplines in that the
philosopher is forever plagued by the question of what his discipline is about
... A beginning student is usually told that philosophy does not deal with facts
but with the analysis of concepts. But this characterization is inadequate beca-
use it seems to suggest that the distinction between factual and the conceptual
is absolute and that concepts can be analyzed entirely on their own. The philos-
opher, in other words, need not bother with what is, has been, or is likely to
be the case.

What emerges is a conception of philosophy that retains its purity by making a
radical distinction between itself and virtually every other form of knowledge.
C.D. Broad once escribed philosophy at Cambridge as "almost completely out of t-
ouch with eneral hisotry, with political theory and sociology, and with jurispr-
udence." Few eyebrows would have been raised if he had thrown in a dozen other
departments and perhaps three or four additional disciplines as well. As for how
it is possible to do, say, ethics in such an environment, Broad and his cohorts
had a ready answer: the moral philosopher must be distinguished from the morali-
st. The latter takes a stand on important ehtical questions and can be refuted
should his evidence prove insufficient. For him to be ignorant of history, poli-
tical theory, and jurisprudence is to run the risk of being wrong. The moral ph-
ilosopher, however, only reflects on the language employed by the moralist. Sin-
ce the philosopher is not in the business of recommending or criticizing courses
of action, he can comfortably ignore the lessons the moralist has to learn.

This conception of philosophy prevailed in the English-speaking world for about
forty years until it fell into disrepute during the turmoil of the sixties. Then
sticky questions began ot be asked: To whom was such analysis addressed and for
what purpose? If the moral philosopher had studied the great ethical system of
the past, why should he not bring his knowledge to bear on the controversial is-
sues of the present? Recently a number of articles have sprung up in the philos-
ophical journals dealing with abortion, homosexuality, recombinant DNA research,
intelligence testing, and other issues once thought to be beyond the scope of p-
hilosophical inquiry. Their presence raises the obvious question: What unique s-
ubject or set of problems distinguishes philosophical inquiry from everything e-
lse?

One difficulty is that while other disciplines investigate a specific range of
phenomena, philosophy, particularly in the hodgepodge conception of it, investi-
gates all of existence. Worse, while the natural sciences seem to get better as
they get older, philosophy does not. Without a bodyof accepted beliefs ot build
on, philosophers can make interesting points, but not step-by-step progress. A
researcher in physics does note have to make a new beginning each time he walks
into his lab; he can assume that there is a consensus on a large number of issu-
es and thus can direct his efforts to a few highly restricted problems.

                                 Existentialism

There are many dictionary definitions of "existentialism"; Central to each defi-
nition, however, is the assertion that existentialism is a theory or statement
about the nature of man's existence. Existentialism is one of a limited number
of views of man's nature, in which existence is all-important. The other views
are that man's nature is one that falls into one of the following categories: an
operational balance among the elements of thoutht, feeling, and sensation-class-
icism; an imbalance weighted in favor of the world of volition's (feeling, emot-
ions, and will) over the world of mind and senses - romanticism; an imbalance a-
mong the categories of head, heart, and hand in favor of thought - rationalism;
an imbalance resulting from choosing the world of materiality, the world of the
senses and things, over the claims of spirit and thought - naturalism.

Existentialism is a view of human existence in the class with classicism, roman-
ticism, rationalism, and naturalism. Obviously, for each individual, the meanin-
gs of each view which differs from all other views in accepting a range of mean-
ing, then the view can be defined at least from a semantic point of view. Wheth-
er one is a romanticist, a rationalist, a classicist, or one in the grim hold of
naturalism, he accepts words describing each as holding the same range of meani-
ng for all views, even including that of existentialism. He accepts the range of
meanings describing each one, although he selects from the range according ot h-
is unique viewpoint. However, since the existentialist denies that he can be bo-
und to the external control of any range of meanings, including those of words,
he can be defined as uniquely different from his _philosophers_. Here, the defi-
nition, and an effective one, is on semantical grounds. He creates his own range
of meanings of words; if they approach those used in the other philosophies of
man's existence, they do so accidentally. The existentialist deliberately - and
unconsciously sometimes - rejects traditional ranges of meaning in his own lang-
uage enviroment. Quite often he does so through using the words in an opposite
sense. We could rest on this linguistic view, and do so safely, did we so desir-
e. However, we can also define existentialism in the light of a historical uniq-
ueness.

                                   Philosophy

In a sense, no intelligent person in his lifetime can entirely escape at least
some informal speculation. In the form of a dilemma, Aristotle presented this t-
ruth in the fragment of one of his lost treatises, Protreptikos: "You say one m-
ust philosophize. You say one should not philosophize. Then to prove your conte-
ntion you must philosophize. In any case you must philosophize." To abandon phi-
losophy altogether is itself a philosophical decision. In spite of some incurio-
us or inept minds, the human intellect is naturally philosophical; it has a que-
nchless thirst for knowledge, not merely for data but for their explorations, j-
ustifications, and proofs; it tries to grasp its findings in an ultimate unders-
tanding of reality. Man's search is always for truth; he even proves truth by t-
ruth. In a popular sense, every thinking person is philosophizing. Philosophy in
the strict, technical sense, however, is quite different from the popular use of
hte term. The hpilosophizing of hte common man is superficial, vague, haphazard,
unconscious, uncritical, and subjective; but philosophy in the strict sense is a
conscious, precise, critical, objective, and systematic study of all things.

Etymologically, the term "philosophy" derives from two Greek words: philia ("lo-
ve") and sophia ("wisdom"). Originally the term sophia designated the carpenter-
's art, the art of navigation and guessing riddles. Later it meant talent in po-
etry and excellence in any art, music in particular. In ancient Greece a wise m-
an was a person characterized by common sense or by great skill and outstanding
persormance in any art. Not until the time of Aristotle, though, did the term
"philosophy" assume a technical meaning, distinguishing it from other branches
of learning.

The main objects of philosophy, those that best indicate its meaning, are specu-
lation and criticism. Concerning speculation, philosophy looks upon things from
the broadest possible perspective; as for criticism, it has the twofold role of
questioning and judging everything that pertains either to the foundations or to
the superstructure of human thinking. [It is interesting to note that the Engli-
sh word "speculation" comes from the Latin verb specere ('to see"), but its imm-
ediate origin is in the noun specula, indicating a "watch tower" or, metonymica-
lly, a "hill". Just as one can see the wide horizon from a tower or a hilltop,
so he obtains through philosophy a broad view of reality.] In short, philosopy
is the science of beings in search of their ultimate reasons, causes, and princ-
iples. As a science of beings, philosophy is concerned with everything that is
or becomes or is known. Whereas the special sciences are looking for the proxim-
ate cause of things, philosophy searches for the ultimate explanations and caus-
es of being.

================================================================================

                                    Paganism

The paganism of the Greeks and Romans, though a religion without salvation or a-
fterlife, was not necessarily indifferent to man's moral behavior. What has mis-
led some historians is that this religion, without theology or church, was, if I
may put it this way, more an a la carte religion than a religion with a fixed m-
enu. If an established church is a "one-party state", then paganism was "free e-
nterprise". Each man was free to found his own temple and preach whatever god he
liked, just as he might open a new inn or peddle a new product. And each man ma-
de himself the client of whichever god he chose, not necessarily his city's fav-
orite deity: the choice was free.

Such freedom was possible because between what the pagans meant by "god" and wh-
at Jews, Christians, and Moslems mean, there is little in common but the name.
For the three religions of the Book, God is infinitely greater than the world w-
hich he created. He exists solely as an actor in a cosmic drama in which the sa-
lvation of humankind is played out. The pagan gods, by contrast, live their liv-
es and are not confined to a metaphysical role. They are part of this world, one
of three races that populate the earth: animals, which are neither immortal nor
gifted with reason; humans, who are mortal but reasonable; and gods, who are im-
mortal and reasonable. So true is it that the divine race is an animal genus th-
at every god is either male or female. From this it follows that the gods of all
peoples are true gods. Other nations might worship gods unknown to the Greeks a-
nd Romans, or they might worship the same gods under different names. Jupiter w-
as Jupiter the world over, just as a lion is a lion, buth he happened to be cal-
led Zeus in Greek, Taranis in Gallic, and Yao in Hebrew. The names of the gods
could be translated from one language to another, just like the names of planets
and other material things. Belief in alien gods foundered only where it was the
product of an absurd superstition, something that smacked of a fantastic bestia-
ry. The Romans laughed at the gods with animal bodies worshipped by the Egyptia-
ns. In the ancient world religious people were as tolerant of one another as are
Hindu sects. To take a special interest in one god was not to deny the others.

This fact was not without conseequence for man's idea of his own place in the n-
atural order. Imagine a circle, which represents the world according to the rel-
igious of the Book. Given man's importance in the cosmic drama, he occupies at
least half the circle. What about God? He is so exalted, so awesome, that he re-
mains far above the circle. To represent him, draw an arrow, pointing upward fr-
om the center of the circle and mark it with the sign of infinity. Now consider
the pagan world. Imagine a sort of staircase with three steps. On the lowest st-
ep stand the animals; on the next step, humans; and on the third step, the gods.
In order to become a god, one did not need to rise very far. The gods stood just
above humans, so that it often makes sense to translate the Latin and Greek wor-
ds for "divine" as "superhuman".

================================================================================

                           The Use of Pure Knowledge

The word _science_ is herad so often in modern times that almost everybody has
some notion of its meaning. On the other hand, its definition is difficult for
many people. The meaning of the term is confused because many endeavors masquer-
ading under the name of science do not have any valid connection with it. There-
fore everyone should understand its import and objectives. Just to make the exp-
lanation as simple as possible, suppose science is defined as classified knowle-
dge (facts). An example that adequately meets the requirements is astronomy. On
the other hand, astrology, regardless of how sincerely it is believed by some,
must be excluded since it is not based on fact. Even in the true sciences disti-
nguishing fact from fiction is not always easy. For this reason great care shou-
ld be taken to distinguish between beliefs and truths. There is no danger as lo-
ng as a clear difference is made between temporary and proved explanations. For
example, hypotheses (tentative theories) and theories are attempts to explain n-
atural phenomena. From these tentative positions the scientist continues to exp-
eriment and observe until they are proved or discredited. The exact status of a-
ny explanation should be clearly labeled to avoid confusion.

The objectives of science are primarily the discovery and the subsequent unders-
tanding of hte unknown. Man cannot be satisfied with recognizing that secrets e-
xist in nature or that questions are unanswerable; he must solve them. Toward t-
hat end specialists in the field of biology and related fields of interest are
directing much of their time and energy. A beginning student should understand
the motivation of science and acquire the spirit of inquiry. That kind of spiri-
t, plus practice in the methods of science, should make a course more meaningfu-
l.

Actually, two basic approaches lead to the discovery of new information. One, a-
imed at satisfying curiosity, is referred to as pure science. The other is aimed
at using knowledge for specific purposes - for instance, improving health, rais-
ing standards of living, or creating new consumer products. In this case knowle-
dge is put to economic use. Such an approach is referred to as applied science.

Sometimes practical-minded people miss the point of pure science in thinking on-
ly of its immediate utilization for economic rewards. One can see that an extra-
ordinary amount of knowledge about chemistry is necessary before one can possib-
ly understand functions of protoplasm like respiration or photosynthesis. Chemi-
sts responsible for many of the discoveries could hardly have anticipated that
their findings would one day result in applications of such a practical nature
as those directly related to life and health. Furthermore, geneticists working
on insects could not foresee all the possible applications of their findings to
the improvement of plants and animals through selective breeding. The discovery
of one bit of information opens the door to the discovery of another. Some disc-
overies seem so simple that one is amazed they were not made years ago; however,
one should remember that the construction of the microscope had to precede the
discovery of the cell, and a knowledge of the chemical nature of oxygen and car-
bon dioxide had to come before a breakthrough in the understanding of photosynt-
hesis. The host of science dedicating their lives to pure science are not apolo-
getic about ignoring the practical side of their discoveries; they know from ex-
perience that most knowledge is eventually applied. Probably one can safely say
that even from a practical point of view all discoveries will eventually be use-
d.

================================================================================

                             Maritain's Philosophy

In _Scholasticism_ and Politics, written during World War II, Maritain expressed
discouragement at the pessimism and lack of self-confidence characteristic of t-
he Western democracies, and in the postwar world he joined enthusiastically in
the resurgence of that confidence. While stopping short of asserting that democ-
racy as a political system flowed directly from correct philosophical principle-
s, he nonetheless dismissed Fascism and Communism as inherently irrational. Bou-
rgeois individualism was, however, implicitly immoral and, by breaking down all
sense of community and shared moral values, would inevitably end in some form of
statism: order imposed from above. In _Integral Humanism_ (1936) and later work-
s, he developed a systematic critique of the prevailing modern political ideolo-
gies and argued that a workable political order, which might appropriately be d-
emocracy, depended on a correct uderstanding of human nature and of natural mor-
al law.

Maritain became something of an Americanophile, seeking to counter not only what
he regarded as European misconceptions about America but also the Americans' own
self-deprecaton. In _Reflections on America_ (1958), he argued that Americans w-
ere not really materialistic but were the most idealistic people in the world,
although theirs was an idealism often unformed and lacking in philosophical bas-
es. America, he thought, offered perhaps the best contemporary prospect for the
emergence of a truly Christian civilization, based not on governmental decree b-
ut on the gradual realization of Christian values on the part of a majority of
the population. American saints were coming, he predicted.

But his postulation of a possible Christian civilization in America did not in
any way temper his optimistic political liberalism - a facet of his thought whi-
ch caused him to be held in suspicion by some of his fellow Catholics in the 19-
50s. The Dominican chaplain at Princeton, for example, refused to allow him to
address the Catholic students. (One of the exquisite ironies of recent Catholic
history was that Maritain in his last books was acerbically critical of secular-
izing priests, while the Doninican chaplain resigned from the priesthood and en-
ded his days as real estate salesman in Florida.)

No doubt in part because of Raissa's background, Maritain had an enduring inter-
est in anti-Semitism, which he analyzed and criticized in two books, and he was
one of hte principal influences in the effort to establish better Jewish-Cathol-
ic relations. Racism he regarded as America's most severe flaw. As early as 1958
he was praising Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Chicago neighborhood organizer
Saul Alinsky.

Martian and, to a lesser extent, Gilson provided the program for a bold kind of
Catholic intellectuality - an appropriation of medieval thought for modern use,
not so much a medieval revival as a demonstration of the perennial relevance of
the medieval philosophical achievement. The modern mind was to be brought back
to its Catholic roots, not by the simple disparagement of modernity of by empha-
sis on the subjective necessity of faith, but by a rigorous and demanding appeal
to reason. In the process, Scholastic principles would be applied in new and of-
ten daring ways.

In the end the gamble failed. Despite promising signs in the 1940s, secular thi-
nkers did not finally find the Scholastic appeal persuasive. And, as is inevita-
ble when an intellectual community is dominated so thoroughly by a single system
of thought, a restiveness was building up in Catholic circles. Although Maritain
insisted that Thomism, because of the central importance it gave to the act of
existence, was the true existentialism, Catholic intellectuals of the 1950s were
attracted to the movement which more usually went by that name; and Gabriel Mar-
cel, a Catholic existentialist of the same generation as Gilson and Maritain, w-
as available to mediate between faith and anguish. Catholic colleges in America
were hospitable to existentialist and phenomenological currents at a time when
few secular institutions were, and what Catholics sought there was primarily a
philosophy which was serious about the metaphysical questions of existence, yet
not as rationalistic, rigid, and abstract as Scholasticism often seemed to be.

================================================================================

                               English Hierarchy

Having rejected Catholicism, English society after the Protestant Reformation f-
elt compelled to impose new order on an uncertain universe. Claiming knowledge
of a divine plan which linked the celestial and natural worlds into one "great
chain of being," some English thinkers depicted humans as the highest link on t-
hat portion of hte chain belonging to the natural world, and human society, in
turn, as comprising a series of vertical political hierarchies. Echoing the ass-
ertion of Elizabeth to a rebellious Parliament that "the feet do not rule the h-
ead," Edward Forset in 1606 elaborated one hierarchy in which the body was topp-
ed, literally and morally, by head and soul. In Forset's scheme both soul and m-
onarchy possessed "unity" or "indivisibility," each uniting and reigning over s-
ubordinate links contained in their respective segments of the worldly chain. G-
iven popular acceptance of the idea of stability as God's will, Elizabeth and h-
er immediate successors possessed a potent, though short-lived, ideological res-
traint.

================================================================================

                                    Du Bois

Given the persistent and intransigent nature of the American race system, which
proved quite impervious to black attacks, Du Bios in his speeches and writings
moved from one proposed solution to another, and the salience of various parts
of his philosophy changed as his perceptions of the needs and strategies of bla-
ck American shifted over time. Aloof and autonomous in his personality, Du Bois
did not hesitate to depart markedly from whatever was the current mainstream of
black thinking when he perceived that the conventional wisdom being enunciated
by black spokesmen was proving inadequate to the task of advancing the race. His
willingness to seek different solutions often placed him well in advance of his
contemporaties, and this, combined with a strong-willed, even arrogant personal-
ity made his career as a black leader essentially a series of stormy conflicts.

Thus Du Bois first achieved his role as a major black leader in the controversy
that arose over the program of Booker T. Washington, the most prominent and inf-
luential black leader at the opening of the twentieth century. Amidst the wave
of lynchings, disfranchisement, and segregation laws, Washington, seeking the g-
ood will of powerful whites, taught blacks not to protest against discriminatio-
n, but to elevate themselves through industrial education, hard work, and prope-
rty accumulation; then, they would ultimately obtain recognition of their citiz-
enship rights. At first Du Bois agreed with this gradualist strategy, but in 19-
03 with the publication of his most influential book, _Souls of Black Folk_, he
became the chief leader of the onslaught against Washington that polarized the
black community into two wings - the "conservative" supporters of Washington and
his "radical" critics.

================================================================================

                           America and World War Two

The establishment of the Third Reich influenced events in American history by s-
tarting a chain of events which culminated in war between Germany and the United
States. The complete destruction of democracy, the persecution of Jews, the war
on religion, the cruelty and barbarism of the Nazis, and especially, the plants
of Germnay and her allies, Italy and Japan, for world conquest caused great ind-
ignation in this country and brought on fear of another world war. While speaki-
ng out against Hitler's atrocities, the American people generally favored isola-
tionist policies and neutrality. The Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1936 prohibited
trade with any belligerents or loans to them. In 1937 the President was empower-
ed to declare an arms embargo in wars between nations at his discretion.

American opinion began to change somewhat after President Roosevelt's "quaranti-
ne the aggressor" speech at Chicago (1937), in which he severely criticized Hit-
ler's policies. Germany's seizure of Austria and the Munich Pact for the partit-
ion of Czechoslovakia (1938) also aroused the American people. The conquest of
Czechoslovakia in March 1939 was another rude awakening to the menace of the Th-
ird Reich. In August 1939 came the shock of the Nazi-Soviet Pact and in Septemb-
er the attack on Poland and the outbreak of European war. The United Stares att-
empted to maintain neutrality in spite of sympathy for the democracies arrayed
against the Third Reich. The Neutrality Act of 1939 repealed the arms embargo a-
nd permitted "cash and carry" exports of arms to belligerent nations. A strong
national defense program was begun. A draft act was passed (1940) to strengthen
the militray services. A Lend-Lease Act (1941) authorized the president to sell,
exchange, or lend materials to any country deemed necessary by him for the defe-
nse of the United States. Help was given to Britain by exchanging certain overa-
ge destroyers for the right to establish American bases in British territory in
the Western Hemisphere. In August 1941 president Roosevelt and Prime Minister C-
hurchill met and issued the Atlantic Charter, which proclaimed the kind of a wo-
rld that should be established after the war. In December 1941 Japan launched an
unprovoked attack on the United States at Pearl Harbor. Immediately thereafter,
Germany declared war on the United States.

================================================================================

                                    Iroquois

The stability that had marked the Iroquois Confederacy's generally pro-British
position was shattered with the overthrow of James II in 1688, the colonial upr-
isings that followed in Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland, and the commence-
ment of King William's War against Louis XIV of France. The increasing French t-
hreat to English hegemony in the interior of North America was signalized by Fr-
ench-led or French-inspired attacks on the Iroquois and on outlying colonial se-
ttlements in New York and New England. The high point of the Iroquois response
was the spectacular raid of August 5, 1689, in which the Iroquois virtually wip-
ed out the French village of Lachine, just outside Montreal. A counterraid by t-
he French on the English village of Schenectady in March, 1690, instilled an ap-
propriate measure of fear among the English and their Iroquois allies.

The Iroquois position at the end of war, which was formalized by treaties made
during the summer of 1701 with the British and the French, and which was mainta-
ined throughout most of the eighteenth century, was one of "aggressive neutrali-
ty" between the two competing European powers. Under the new system the Iroquois
initiated a peace policy toward the "far Indians," tightened their control over
the nearby tribes, and induced both English and French to support their neutral-
ity toward the European powers by appropriate gifts and concessions.

By holding the balance of power in the sparsely settled borderlands between Eng-
lish and French settlements, and by their willingness to use their power against
one or the other nation if not appropriately treated, the Iroquois played the g-
ame of European power politics with effectiveness. The system broke down, howev-
er, after the Frech became convinced that the Iroquois were compromising the sy-
stem in favor of the English and launched a full-scale attempt to establish Fre-
nch physical and juridical presence in the Ohio Valley, the heart of the border-
lands, long claimed by the Iroquois. As a consequence of the ensuing Great War
for Empire, in which Iroquois neutrality was dissolved and European influence m-
oved closer, the play-off system lost its efficacy and a system of direct barga-
ining supplanted it.

                         The Constitutional Convention

The delegates to the Constitutional Convention were realists. They knew that the
greatest battles would take place after the convention, once the Constitution h-
ad already been drafted adn signed. The delegates had overstepped their bounds.
Instead of amending the Articles of Confederation by which the American states
had previously been governed, they had proposed an entirely new government. Und-
er these circumstances, the convention was undderstandably reluctant to submit
its work to the Congress for approval.

Instead, the delegates decided to pursue what amounted to a revolutionary cours-
e. They declared that ratification of the new Constitution by nine states would
be sufficient to establish the new government. In other words, the Constitution
was being submitted directly to the people. Not even the Congress, which had ca-
lled the convention, would be asked to approve its work.

The leaders of the convention shrewdly wished to bypass the state legislatures,
which were attached to states rights and which required in most cases the agree-
ment of two houses. For speedy ratification of the Constitution, the single-cha-
mbered, specially elected state ratifying conventions offered the greatest prom-
ise of agreement.

Battle lines were quickly drawn. The Federalists, as the supporters of the Cons-
titution were called, had one solid advantage: they came with a concrete propos-
al. Their opponents, the Antifederalists, came with none. Since the Antifederal-
ists were opposing something with nothing, their objections, though sincere, we-
re basically negative. They stood for a policy of drift while the Federalists w-
ere providing clear leadership.

Furthermore, although the Antifederalists claimed to be the democratic group, t-
heir opposition to the Constitution did not necessarily spring from a more demo-
cratic view of government. Many of the Antifederalists were as distrustful of t-
he common people as their opponents. In New York, for example, Governor George
Clinton criticized the people for their fickleness and their tendency to "vibra-
te from one extreme to another." Elbridger Gerry of Massachusetts, who refused
to sign the Constitution, asserted that "the evils we experience flow from the
excess of democracy," and John F.Mercer of Maryland professed little faith in h-
is neighbors as voters when he said that "the people cannot know and judge the
character of candidates."

================================================================================

                                The US Military

The National Security Act of 1947 created a national military establishment hea-
ded by a single Secretary of Defense. The legislation had been a year-and-a-half
in the making - beginning when President Truman first recommended that the armed
services be reorganized into a single department. During that period the Presid-
ent's concept of a unified armed service was torn apart and put back together s-
everal times, the final measure to emerge from Congress being a compromise. Most
of the opposition to the bill came from the Navy and its numerous civilian spok-
esmen, including Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. In support of unificati-
on (and a separate air force that was part of the unification package) were the
Army air forces, the Army, and, most importantly, the President of the United S-
tates.

Passage of the bill did not bring an end to the bitter interservice disputes. R-
ather than unify, the act served only to federate the military services. It nei-
ther halted the rapid demobilization of the armed forces that followed World War
II nor brought to the new national military establishment the loyalties of offi-
cers steeped in the traditions of the separate services. At a time when the bal-
ance of power in Europe and Asia was rapidly shifting, the services lacked any
precise statement of United States foreign policy from the National Security Co-
uncil on which to base future programs. The services bickered unceasingly over
their respective roles and missions, already complicated by the Soviet nuclear
capability that for the first time made the United States subject to devastating
attack. Not even the appointment of Forrestal as First Secretary of Defense all-
ayed the suspicions of naval officers and their supporters that the role of the
U.S. Navy was threatened with permanent eclipse. Before the war of words died d-
own, Forrestal himself was driven to resignation and then suicide.

By 1948, the United States military establishment was forced to make do with a
budget approximately 10 percent of what it had been at its wartime peak. Meanwh-
ile, the cost of weapons procurement was rising geometrically as the nation came
to put more and more reliance on the atomic bomb and its delivery system. These
two factors inevitably made adversaries of the Navy and the Air Force as the ba-
ttle between advocates of the B - 36 and the supercarrier so amply demonstrates.
Given severe fiscal restraints on the one hand, and on the other the nation's i-
ncreasing reliance on strategic nuclear deterrence, the conflict between these
two services over roles and missions ws essentially a contest over slices of an
ever-diminishing pie.

Yet if in the end neither service was the obvious victor, the principle of civi-
lian dominance over the military clearly was. If there had ever been any danger
that the United States military establishment might exploit, to the detriment of
civilian control, the goodwill it enjoyed as a result of its victories in World
War II, that danger disappeared in the interservice animosities engendered by t-
he battle over unification.

================================================================================

                                  Indian Caste

The Hindu conception of society was static and was dominated by the idea of cas-
te. The traditional fourfold order of priests, soldiers and administrators, mer-
chants and agriculturalists, and menial workers not only was considered to be a-
bsolute, fundamental and necessary to society but also was given a divine sanct-
ion by being considered a creation of God (Brahma). According to this view, peo-
ple born into the different castes had certain biologically inherited aptitudes
that eminently fitted them to perform the caste functions it was their duty to
perform.

Agains this should be set the dynamic evolutionary conception of society as pic-
tured in early Buddhism. Here the fourfold order was not considered absolute be-
cause, as the Buddha said, in certain societies there are only two classes - the
lords and the serfs, or the masters and the slaves - and their division is not a
rigid one since "the masters sometimes become slaves and the slaves, masters."
Nor is caste divine in origin. The belief that caste was a creation of God and
that the Brahmans, Hindus of the highest priestly caste, were the chosen childr-
en of God, a conception as odl as the Rigveda, is denied in the Buddhist texts.
In place of the conception of a divinely ordained fourfold order, Buddhism conc-
eived of caste divisions as occupational divisions that arose owing to historic-
al circumstances and considered the perpetuation of caste prejudice and discrim-
ination as being due largely to the sanctions given them by the early Brahmans.

This is well brought out in the story of Devala the Dark, a well-known priest w-
ho was scorned because of his color by the other priestly seers, who were said,
in the words of the Buddha, to have gotten together and formulated the "false a-
nd evil view" (papakam ditthigatam) that "the Brahmans alone were saved while t-
he others were not." If this legend contains a germ of historical truth, then,
in the words of Ghurye, "Caste in India must be regarded as a Brahmanic child of
the Indo; Aryan culture, cradled in the land of the Ganges and thence transferr-
ed to the other parts of India."

                                     Chile

Chile's human history apparently began about 10,000 years ago when migrating In-
dians followed the line of hte Andes and settled in fertile valleys and along t-
he coast. The Incas briefly extended their empire into the north, but the area's
remoteness prevented any siguificant effect. In 1541, the Spanish, under Pedro
de Valdivia, encountered about one million Indians from various cultures who su-
pported themselves primarily through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting. Al-
though the Spaniards did not find the gold and silver they had sought there, th-
ey recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile b-
ecame part of the Viceroyalty of Peru.

Chilean colonial society was beavily influenced by the latifundio system to lar-
ge landholdings, kinship politics, the Roman Catholic Church, and an aggressive
frontier attitude stemming from Indian wars. The drive for independence from Sp-
ain was precipitated by usurpation of the Spanish throne by Napoleon's brother
Joseph. A national junta in the name of Ferdinand - heir to the deposed king -
was formed on September 18, 1810. Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule r-
ule during the Reconquista led to a prolonged struggle under Bernardo O'Higgins,
Chile's most renowned patriot. Chilean independence was formally proclaimed on
February 12, 1818.

The political revolution brought little social change, however, and 19th century
Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structu-
re. The system of presidential absolutism eventually predominated, but the weal-
thy land owners continued to control Chile. Although Chile established a repres-
entative democracy in the early 20th century, it soon became unstable and degen-
erated into a system protecting the interests of the ruling oligarchy. By the 1-
920s, the newly emergent middle and working classes were powerful enough to ele-
ct a reformist president, but his program was frustrated by a conservative cong-
ress. Continuing political and economic instability resulted in the quasidictat-
orial rule of General Carlos Ibanez (1924-1932).

After constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the
Radicals, formed. The Radical Party became the key force in coalition governmen-
ts for the next 20 years. The 1920s saw the emergence of Marxist groups with st-
rong popular support. During the period of Radical Party dominance (1932-1952),
the state increased its role in the economy. However, presidents generally were
more conservative than the parties supporting them, and conservative political
elements continued to exert considerable power through their influence over the
economy and control of rural voters.

                                Women's Movement

Although the study of women's history has only been developed as an academic di-
scipline in the last twenty years, it is not the case that the current wave of
feminist activity is the first in which interest in women's past was manifest.
From its very beginnings, the nineteenth-century English women's movement sought
to expand existing knowledge of the activities and achievements of women in the
past. At the same time, like its American counterpart, the English women's move-
ment had a powerful sense ofits own historic importance and of its relationship
to wider social and policical change.

Nowhere is this sense of the historical importance - and of the historical conn-
ections between the women's movement and other social and political development
- more evident than in Ray Strachey's classic account of the movement, _The Cau-
se_. "The true history of the Women's Movement," Strachey argues, "is the whole
history of the nineteenth century." The women's movement was part of the broad
sweep of liberal and progressive reform which was transforming society. Strachey
emphasized this connection between the women's movement and the broader sweep of
history by highlighting the importance for it of the Enlightenment and the Indu-
strial Revolution. The protest made by the women's movement at the confinement
and injustices faced by women was, in Strachey's view, part of the liberal atta-
ck on traditional prejudices and injustice. This critique of women's confinement
was supplemented by the demand for recognition fo women's role in the public, p-
articularly the philanthropic realm. Indeed, it was the criticism of the limita-
tions faced by women on the one hand, and their establishment of a new public r-
ole on the other hand, which provided the core of the movement, determining also
its form: its organization around campaigns for legal, political and social ref-
orm.

Strachey's analysis was a very illuminating one, nowhere more so than in her in-
sistence that, despite their differences and even antipathy to each other, both
the radical Mary Wollstonecraft and evangelical Hannah More need to be seen as
forerunners of the mid-Victorian feminism. At the same time, she omitted some i-
ssues which now seem crucial to any discussion of the context of Victorian femi-
nism. Where Strachey pictured a relatively fixed image of domestic women throug-
hout the first half of the nineteenth century, recent historical and literary w-
orks suggest that this image was both complex and unstable. The establishment of
a separate domestic sphere for women was but one aspect of the enormous change
in sexual and familial relationships which were occurring from the late eightee-
nth century through to the mid nineteenth. These changes were accompanied by bo-
th anxiety and uncertainty and by the constant articulation of women's duty in a
new social world.

                                 American Negro

The beginning of what was to become the United States was characterized by inco-
nsistencies in the values and behavior of its population, inconsistencies that
reflected by its spokesmen, who took conflicting stances in many areas; but on
the subject of race, the conflicts were particularly vivid. The idea that the C-
aucasian race and European civilization were superior was well entrenched in the
culture of the colonists at the very time that the "egalitarian" republic was f-
ounded. Voluminous historical evidence indicates that, in the mind of the avera-
ge colonist, the African was a heathen, he was black, and he was different in c-
rucial philosophical ways. As time progressed, he was also increasingly captive,
adding to the conception of deviance. The African, therefore, could be justifia-
bly (and even philanthropically) treated as property according to the reasoning
of slave traders and slaveholders.

Although slaves were treated as objects, bountiful evidence suggests that they
did not view themselves similarly. There are many published autobiographies of
slaves, and Afro-American scholars are beginning to know enough about West Afri-
can culture to appreciate the existential climate in which the early captives w-
ere raised and which, therefore, could not be totally destroyed by the enslavem-
ent experience. This was a climate that defined individuality in collective ter-
ms. Individuals were inherently a part of the natural elements on which they de-
pended, and they were actively related to those tribal members who once lived a-
nd to those not yet born.

The colonial plantation system that was established and into which Africans were
thrust did virtually eliminate tribal affiliations. Individuals were separated
from kin; interrelationships among kin kept together were often transient becau-
se of sales. A new identification with those slaves working and living together
in a given place could satisfy what was undoubtedly a natural tendency to be a
member of a group. New family units became the most important attachments of in-
dividual slaves. Thus, as the system of slavery was gradually institutionalized,
West African affiliation tendencies adapted to it.

This exceedingly complex dual influence is still reflected in black community l-
ife, and the double consciousness of black Americans is the major characteristic
of Afro-American mentality. DuBois articulated this divided consciousness as fo-
llows:

The history ofthe American Negro is the history of this strife - this longing to
attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer
self. In this merging, he wishes neither of the older selves to be best.

Several black political movements have looked upon this duality as destructively
conflictual and have variously urged its reconciliation. Thus, the integrationi-
sts and the black nationalists, to be crudely general, have both been concerned
with resolving the conflict, but in opposite directions.

================================================================================

                                  Mary Bethune

Like her white friends Eleanor Roosevelt and Aubrey Williams, Mary Bethune beli-
eved in the fundamental commitment of the New Deal to assist the black American-
's struggle and in the need for blacks to assume responsibilities to help win t-
hat struggle. Unlike those of her white liberal associates, however, Bethune's
ideas had evolved out of a long experience as a "race leader." Founder of a sma-
ll black college in Florida, she had become widely known by 1935 as an organizer
of black women's groups and as a civil and political rights activist. Deeply re-
ligious, certain of her own capabilities, she held a relatively uncluttered view
of what she felt were the New Deal's and her own people's obligations to the ca-
use of racial justice. Unafraid to speak her mind to powerful whites, including
the President, or to differing black factions, she combined faith in the ultima-
te willingness of whites to discard their prejudice and bigotry with a strong s-
ense of racial pride and commitment to Negro self-help.

More than her liberal white friends, Bethune argued for a strong and direct bla-
ck voice in initiating and shaping government policy. She pursued this in her c-
onversations with President Roosevelt, in numerous memoranda to Aubrey Williams,
and in her administrative work as head of the National Youth Administration's O-
ffice of Negro Affairs. With the assistance of Williams, she was successful in
having blacks selected to NYA posts at the national, state, and local levels. B-
ut she also wanted a black presence throughout the federal government. At the b-
eginning of the war she joined other black leaders in demanding appointments to
the Selective Service Board and to the Department of the Army; and she was inst-
rumental in 1941 in securing Earl Dickerson's membership on the Fair Employment
Practices Committee. By 1944, she was still making appeals for black representa-
tion in "all public programs, federal, state, and local." and "in policy-making
posts as well as rank and file jobs."

Though recognizing the weakness in the Roosevelt administration's response to N-
egro needs, Mary Bethune remained in essence a black partisan champion of the N-
ew Deal during the 1930s and 1940s. Her strong advocacy of administration polic-
ies adn programs was predicated on a number of factors: her assessment of the l-
ow status of black Americans during the Depression; her faith in the willingness
of some liberal whites to work for the inclusion of blacks in the government's
reform and recovery measures; her conviction that only massive federal aid could
elevate the Negro economically; and her belief that the thirties and forties we-
re producing a more self-aware and self-assured black population. Like a number
of her white friends in government, Bethune assumed that the preservation of de-
mocracy and balck people's "full integration into the benefits and the responsi-
bilites" of American life were inextricably tied together. She was convinced th-
at, with the help of a friendly government, a militant, aggressive "New Negro"
would emerge out of the devastation of depression adn war, a "New Negro" who wo-
uld "save America from itself," who would lead America toward the full realizat-
ion of its democratic ideas.

================================================================================

       Hamilton's Interference in Thomas Pinckney's Presidental Election

To broaden their voting appeal in the Presidential election of 1796, the Federa-
lists selected Thomas Pinckney, a leading South Carolinian, as running mate for
the New Englander John Adams. But Pinckney's Southern friends chose to ignore t-
heir party's intentions and regarded Pinckney as a Presidential candidate, crea-
ting a political situation that Alexander Hamilton was determined to exploit. H-
amilton had long been wary of Adams' stubbornly independent brand of politics a-
nd preferred to see his running mate, over whom he could exert more control, in
the President's chair.

The election was held under the system originally established by the Constituti-
on. At that time there was but a single tally, with the candidate receiving the
largest number of electoral votes declared President and the candidate with the
second largest number declared Vice-president. Hamilton anticipated that all the
Federalists in the North would vote for Adams and Pinckney equally in an attempt
to ensure that Jefferson would not be either first or second in the voting. Pin-
ckney would be solidly supported in the Sough while Adams would not. Hamilton c-
oncluded if it were possible to divert a few electoral votes from Adams to Pinc-
kney, Pinckney would receive more than Adams, yet both Federalists would outpoll
Jefferson.

Various methods were used to persuade the electors to vote as Hamilton wished.
In the press, anonymous articles were published attacking Adams for his monarch-
ical gendencies and Jefferson for being overly democratic, while pushing Pinckn-
ey as the only suitable candidate. In private correspondence with state party l-
eaders the Hamiltonians encouraged the idea that Adams' popularity was slipping,
that he could not win the election, and that the Federalists could defeat Jeffe-
rson only by supporting Pinckney.

Had sectional pride and loyalty not run as high in New England as in the deep S-
outh, Pinckney might well have become Washington's successor. New Englanders, h-
owever, realized that equal votes for Adams and Pinckney in their states would
defeat Adams; therefore, eighteen electors scratched Pinckney's name from their
ballots and deliberately threw away their second votes to men who were not even
running. It was fortunate for Adams that they did, for the electors from South
Carolina completely abandoned him, giving eight votes to Pinckney and eight to
Jefferson.

In the end, Hamilton's interference in Pinckney's candidacy lost even the Vice-
Presidency of South Carolina. Without New England's support, Pinckney received
only 59 electoral votes, finishing third to Adams and Jefferson. He might have
been presidetn in 1797, or as Vice-President a serious contender for the Presid-
ency in 1800; instead, stigmatized by a plot he had not devised, he served a br-
ief term in the United States Senate and then dropped from sight as a national
influence.

================================================================================

                               The Aleut Language

The Aleuts, residing on several islands of the Aleutian Chain, the Pribilof Isl-
ands, and the Alaskan Peninsula, have possessed a written language since 1825,
when the Russian missionary Ivan Veniaminov selected appropriate characters of
Cyrillic alphabet to represent Aleut speech sounds, recorded the main body of A-
leut vocabulary, and formulated grammatical rules. The Czarist Russian conquest
of the proud, independent sea hunters was so devastatingly thorough that majori-
ty of an adult generation was sufficient to destroy the continuity of tribal kn-
owledge, which was dependent upon oral transmission. As a consequence, the Aleu-
ts developed a fanatical devotion to their language as their only cultural heri-
tage.

The Russian occupation placed a heavy linguistic burden on the Aleuts. Not only
were they compelled to learn Russian to converse with their overseers and gover-
nors, but they had to learn Old Slavonic to take an active part in church servi-
ces as well as to master the skill of reading adn writing their own tongue. In
1867, when the United States purchased Alaska, the Aleuts were unable to break
sharply with their immediate past and substitute English for any one of their t-
hree languages.

To communicants of the Russian Orthodox Church a knowledge of Slavonic remained
vital, as did Russian, the language in which one conversed with the clergy. The
Aleuts came to regards English education as a device to wean them from their re-
ligious faith. The instoduction of compulsory English schooling caused a minor
renascence of Russian culture as the Aleut parents sought to counteract the inf-
luence of the schoolroom. The harsh life of the Russian colonial rule began to
appear more happy and beautiful in retrospect.

Regulations forbidding instruction in any language other than English increased
its unpopularity. The superficial alphabetical resemblance of Russian and Aleut
linked the two tongues so closely that every restriction against teaching Russi-
an was interpreted as an attempt to eradicate the Aleut tongue. From the wording
of many regulations, it appears that American administrators often had not the
slightest idea that the Aleuts were clandestinely reading and writing their own
tongue or even had a written language of their own. To too many officials, anyt-
hing in Cyrillic letters was Russian and something to be stamped out. Bitterness
bred by abuses and the exploitations the Aleuts suffered from predatory American
traders and adventurers kept alive the Aleut resentment against the language sp-
oken by Americans. Gradually, despite the failure to emancipate the Aleuts from
a sterile past by relating the Aleut and English languages more closely, the pa-
ssage of years has assuaged the bitter misunderstandings and caused an orientat-
ion away from Russian toward English as their second language, but Aleut contin-
ues to be the language that molds their thought and expression.

================================================================================

                               Cultural Asphyxia

Above all, colonialism was hated for its explicit assumption that the civilizat-
ions of colonized peoples were inferior. Using slogans like The White Man's Bur-
den and La Mission Civilicatrice, Europeans asserted their moral obligations to
impose their way of life on those endowed with inferior cultures. This orientat-
ion was particularly blatant among the French. In the colonies, business was co-
nducted in French. Schools used that language and employed curricula designed f-
or children in France. One scholar suggests that Muslim children probably learn-
ed no more about the Maghreb than they did about Australia. In the Metropole, i-
ntellectuals discoursed on the weakness of Arabo-Islamic culture. A noted histo-
rian accused Islam of being hostile to science. An academician wrote that Arabic
- the holy language of religion, art and the Muslim sciences - is "more of an e-
ncumbrance than an aid to the mind. It is absolutely devoid of precision." There
was of course an element fo truth in the criticisms. After all, Arab reformists
had been engaging in self-criticism for decades. Also, at least some Frenchmen
honestly believed they were helping the colonized. A Resident General in Tunisi-
a, for example, told an assemblage of Muslims with sincerity, "We shall distrib-
ute to you all that we have of learning; we shall make you a party to everything
that makes for the strength of our intelligence." But none of this could change
or justify the cultural racism in colonial ideologies. To the French, North Afr-
icans were only partly civilized and could be saved only becoming Frenchmen. The
reaction of the colonized was of course to defend his identity and to label col-
onial policy, in the words of Algerian writer Malek Hadad, "cultural asphyxia."
Throughout North Africa, nationalists made the defense of Arabo-Islamic civiliz-
ation a major objective, a value in whose name they demanded independence. Yet
the crisis of identity, provoked by colonial experiences, has not been readily
assured adn lingers into the post-colonial period. A French scholar describes t-
he devastating impact of colonialism by likening it to "the role player for us
(in Europe) by the doctrine of original sin." Frantz Fanon, especially in his S-
tudies in a Dying Colonialism, well expresses the North African perspective.

Factors producing militant and romantic cultural nationalism are anchored in ti-
me. Memories of colonialism are already beginning to fade and, when the Maghreb
had had a few decades in which to grow, dislocations associated with social cha-
nge can also be expected to be fewer. Whether this means that the cultural nati-
onalism characteristic of the Maghreb today will disappear in the future cannot
be known. But a preoccupation with identity and culture and affirmation of Arab-
ism and Islam have characterized the Maghreb since independence and these still
remain today important elements in Notth African life.

A second great preoccupation in independent North Africa is the promotion of a
modernist social revolution. The countries of the Maghreb do not pursue develop-
ment in the same way and there have been variations in policies within each cou-
ntry. But all three spend heavily on development. In Tunisia, for example, the
government devotes 20-25% of its annual budget to education, and literacy has c-
limbed from 15% in 1956 to about 50% today. A problem, however, is that such ad-
vances are not always compatible with objectives flowing from North African nat-
ionalism. In Morocco, for instance, when the government decided to give children
an "Arab" education, it was forced to limit enrollments because, among other th-
ings, most Moroccans had been educated in French and the country consequently h-
ad few teachers qualified to teach in Arabic. Two years later, with literacy ra-
tes declining, this part of the Arabization program was postponed. The director
of Arabization declared, "We are not fanatics; we want to enter the modern worl-
d."

================================================================================

                        Civic Education of the Republic

The founders of the Republic viewed their revolution primarily in political rat-
her than economic or social terms. And they talked about education as essential
to the public good - a goal that took precedence over knowledge as occupational
training or as a means to self-fulfillment or sel-improvement. Over and over ag-
ain, the Revolutionary generation, both liberal and conservative in outlook, as-
serted its conviction that the welfare of the Republic rested upon an educated
citizenry and that schools, especially free public schools, would be the best m-
eans of educating the citizenry in civic values and the obligations required of
everyone in a democratic republican society. All agreed that the principal ingr-
edients of a civic education were literacy and the inculcation of patriotic and
moral virtues, some others adding the study of history and the study of princip-
les of the republican government itself.

The founders, as was the case of almost all their successors, were long on exho-
rtation and rhetoric regarding the value of civic education, but they left it to
the textbook writers to distill the essence of those values for school children.
Texts in American history and government appeared as early as the 1790s. The te-
xtbook writers turned out to be very largely of conservative persuasion, more l-
ikely Feferalist in outlook than Jeffersonian, and almost universally agreed th-
at political virtue must rest upon moral and religious precepts. Since most tex-
tbook writers were New Englanders, this meant that the texts were infused with
Protestant and, above all, Puritan outlooks.

In the first half of the Republic, civic education in the schools emphasized the
inculcation of civic values and made little attempt to develop participatory po-
litical skills. That was a task left to incipient political parties, town meegi-
ngs, churchs, and the coffee or ale houses where men gathered for conversation.
Additionally, as a reading of certain Federalist papers of the period would dem-
onstrate, the press probably did more to disseminate realistic as well as parti-
san knowledge of government than the schools. The goal of education, however, w-
as to achieve a higher form of for the new Republic. In the middle half of the
nineteenth century, the political values taught in the public and private schoo-
ls did not change substantially from those celebrated in the first fifty years
of the Republic. In the textbooks of the day, their rosy hues if anything became
golden. To the resplendent values of liberty, equality, and a benevolent Christ-
ian morality were now added the middle-class virtues - especially of New England
- of hard work, honesty and integrity, the rewards of individual effort, and ob-
edience to parents and legitimate authority. But of all the political values ta-
ught in school, patriotism was preeminent; and whenever teachers explained to s-
chool children why they should love their country above all else, the idea of l-
iberty assumed pride of place.

                  Voyage of Leif and Biarni in Two Narratives

In the summer of 999, Leif Ericsson voyaged to Norway and spent the following w-
inter with King Olaf Tryggvason. Substantially the same account is given by both
the Saga of Eric the Red and the Flat Island Book. Of Leif's return voyage to G-
reenland the latter says nothing, but according to the former it was during this
return voyage that Leif discovered America. The Flat Island Book, however, tells
of another and earlier landfall by Biarni, the son of a prominent man named Her-
iulf, and makes of this Leif's inspiration for the voyage to the new land. In s-
hort, like Leif, Biarni and his companions sight three countries in succession
before reaching Greenladn, and to come upon each new land takes 1 "doegr" more
than the last until Biarni comes to land directly in front of his father's house
in the last-mentioned country.

This narrative has been rejected by most later writers, and they may be justifi-
ed. Possibly, Biarni was a companion of Leif when he voyaged from Norway to Gre-
enland via America, or it may be that the entire tale is but a garbled account
of that voyage and Biarni another name for Leif. It should be noted, however, t-
hat the stories of Leif's visit to King Olaf and Biarni's to that king's predec-
essor are in the same narrative in the Flat Island Book, so there is less likel-
ihood of duplication than if they were from different sources. Also, Biarni lan-
ded on none of the lands he passed, but Leif apparently landed on one, for he b-
rough back specimens of wheat, vines, and timber. Nor is there any good reason
to believe that the first land visited by Biarni was Wineland. The first land w-
as "level and covered with woods," and "there were small hillocks upon it." Of
forests, later writers do not emphasize them particularly in connection with Wi-
neland, though they are often noted incidentally; and of hills, the Saga says of
Wineland only that "whatever there was hilly ground, there were vines."

Additionally, if the two narratives were taken from the same source we should e-
xpect a closer resemblance of Helluland. The Saga says of it: "They found there
hillus" (large flat stones). According the Biarni narrative, however, "this land
was high and mountainous." The intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 4 "doegr" in both narr-
atives are suggestive, but mythic formulas of this kind may be introduced into
narratives without altogether destroying their historicity. It is also held aga-
inst the Biarni narrative that its hero is made to come upon the coast of Green-
land exactly in front of his father's home. But it should be recalled that Heri-
ulfsness lay below two high mountains which served as landmarks for navigators.
I would give up Biarni more readily were it not that the story of Leif's voyage,
contained in the supposedly more reliable Saga, is almost as amazing. But Leif's
voyage across the entire width of the north Atlantic is said to be "probable" b-
ecause it is documented in the narrative of a preferred authority, while Biarni-
's is "improbable" or even "impossible" because the document containing it has
been condemned.

                       Desegregation in Public Education

During the 1930s, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N-
AACP) attorneys Charles H.Houston, William Hastie, James M.Nabrit, Leon Ransom,
and Thurgood Marshall charted a legal strategy designed to end segregation in e-
ducation. They developed a series of legal cases challenging segregation in gra-
duate and professional schools. Houston believed that the battle against segreg-
ation had to begin at the highest academic level in order to mitigate fear of r-
ace mixing that could create even greater hostility and reluctance on the part
of white judges. After establishing a series of favorable legal precedents in h-
igher education, NAACP attorneys planned to launch an all-out attack on the sep-
arate-but-equal doctrine in primary and secondary schools. The strategy proved
successful. In four major United States Supreme Court decisions, precedents were
established that would enable the NAACP to construct a solid legal foundation u-
pon which the Brown case could rest: Missouri exrel.Gaines V. Canada, Registrar
of the University of Missouri (1938); Sipuel V. Board of Regents of the Univers-
ity of Oklahoma (1948); Mclaurin V. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education
(1950); _and Sweatt V. Painter_ (1950).

In the Oklahoma case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to
enroll in the university. The Oklahoma Regents responded by separating black and
white students in cafeterias and classrooms. The 1950 McLaurin decision ruled t-
hat such internal separation was unconstitutional. In the Sweatt ruling, delive-
red on the same day, the Supreme Court held that the maintenance of separate law
schools for whites and blacks was unconstitutional. A year after Herman Sweatt
entered the University of Texas law school, desegregation cases were filed in t-
he states of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, and in the District
of Columbia asking the courts to apply the qualitative test of the Sweatt case
to the elementary and secondary schools and to declare the separate-but-equal d-
octrine invalid in the area of public education.

The 1954 _Brown V. Board of Education_ decision declared that a classification
based solely on race violated the 14th Amendment ot the United States Constitut-
ion. The decision reversed the 1896 _Plessy V. Ferguson_ ruling which had estab-
lished the separate-but-euqal doctrine. The _Brown_ decision more than any other
case launched the "equalitarian revolution" in American jurisprudence and signa-
led the emerging primacy of equality as a guide to constitutional decisions; ne-
vertheless, the decision did not end state-sanctioned segregation. Indeed, the
second _Brown_ decision, known as _Brown II_ and delivered a year later, played
a decisive role in limiting the effectiveness and impact of the 1954 case by pr-
oviding southern states with the opportunity to delay the implementation of des-
egregation.

The intervention of the federal government and the deployment of the National G-
uard in the 1954 Little Rock crisis, and again in 1963 when the enrollment of J-
ames Meredith desegregated the University of Mississippi, highlight the role of
federal power in promoting social change during this era. While black local and
national leaders organized and orchestrated the legal struggles, and students j-
oined in freedom rides and staged sit-ins, another euqally important dimension
of the rights quest took shape: the battle between federal and state authority
and the evolution of the doctrine of federalism. The fact remains that the Unit-
ed States Supreme Court lacked the power to enforce its decisions. President Dw-
ight D.Eisenhower's use of federal troops in Little Rock was a major departure
from the reluctance of past presidents to display federal power in the South, e-
specially to protect the lives and rights of black citizens.

                          Private and Public Hospitals

Public general hospitals originated in the almshouse infirmaries established as
early as colonial times by local governments to care for the poor. Later, in the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the infirmary separated from the
almshouse and became an independent institution supported by local tax money. At
the same time, private charity hospitals began to develop. Both private and pub-
lic hospitals provided mainly food and shelter for the impoverished sick, since
there was little that medicine could actually do to cure illness, and the middle
class was treated at home by private physicians.

Late in the nineteenth century, the private charity hospital began trying to at-
tract middle-class patients. Although the depression of 1890 stimulated the gro-
wth of charitable institutions and an expanding urban population became depende-
nt on assistance, there was a decline in private contributions to these organiz-
ations which forced them to look to local government for financial support. Sin-
ce private institutions had also lost benefactors, they began to charge patient-
s. In order to attract middle-class patients, private institutions provided ser-
vices and amenities that distinguished between paying and non-paying patients a-
nd made the hospital a desirable place for private physicians to treat their own
patients. As paying patients became more necessary to the survival of the priva-
te hospital, the public hospitals slowly became the only place for the poor to
get treatment. By the end of the nineteenth century, cities were reimbursing pr-
ivate hospitals for their care of indigent patients and the public hospitals re-
mained dependent on the tax dollars.

The advent of private hospital health insurance, which provided middle-class pa-
tients with hte purchasing power to pay for private hospital services, guarante-
ed the private hospital a regular source of income. Private hospitals resticted
themselves to revenue-generating patients, leaving the public hospitals to care
for the poor. Although public hospitals continued to provide services for patie-
nts with communicable diseases and outpatient and emergency services, the Blue
Cross plans developed around the needs of the private hospitals and the inpatie-
nts they served. Thus, reimbursement for ambulatory care has been minimal under
most Blue Cross plans, and provision of outpatient care has not been a major fu-
nction of the private hospital, in part because private patients can afford to
pay for the services of private physicians. Additionally, since World War II, t-
here has been a tremendous influx of federal money into private medical schools
and the hospitals associated with them. Further, large private medical centers
with expensive research equipment and programs have attracted the best administ-
rators, physicians, and researchers. As a result of the greater resources avail-
able to the private medical centers, public hospitals have increasing problems
attracting highly qualified research and medical personnel. With the mainstream
of health care firmly established in the private medical sector, the public hos-
pital has become a "dumping ground."

                               Japanese Character

The uniqueness of the Japanese character is the result of two seemingly contrad-
ictory forces: the strength of traditions, and selective receptivtiy to foreign
achievements and inventions. As early as the 1860s, there were counter movements
to the traditional orientation. Yukichi Fukuzawa, the most eloquent spokesman of
Japan's "Enlightenment," claimed "The Confucian civilization of the East seems
to lack two things possessed by Western civilization: science in the material s-
phere and a sense of independence in the spiritual sphere." Fukuzawa's great in-
fluence is found in the free and individualistic philosophy of the Education Co-
de of 1872, but he was not able to prevent the government from turning back to
the canons of Confucian thought in the Imperial Prescript of 1890. Another inte-
rlude of relative liberalism followed World War I, when the democratic idealism
of President Woodrow Wilson had an important impact on Japanese intellectuals a-
nd, especially students; but more important was the Leninist ideology of the 19-
17 Bolshevik Revolution. Again, in the early 1930s, nationalism and militarism
became dominant, largely as a result of failing economic conditions.

Following the end of World War II, substantial changes were undertaken in Japan
liberate the individual from authoritarian restraints. The new democratic value
system was accepted by many teachers, students, intellectuals, and old liberals,
but it was not immediately embraced by the society as a whole. Japanese traditi-
ons were dominated by group values, and notions of personal freedom and individ-
ual rights were unfamiliar.

Today, democratic processes are clearly evident in the widespread participation
of the Japanese people in social and political life; yet, there is no universal-
ly accepted and stable value system. Values are constantly modified by strong i-
nfusions of Western ideas, both democratic and Marxist. School textbooks expound
democratic principles, emphasizing equality over hierarchy and rationalism over
tradition; but in practice these values are often misinterpreted and distorted,
particularly by the youth who translate the individualistic and humanistic goals
of democracy into egoistic and materialistic ones.

Most Japanese people have consciously rejected Confucianism, but vestiges of the
old order remain. An important feature of relationships in many institutions su-
ch as political parties, large corporations, and university faculties is the _o-
yabun-kobun_ or parent-child relation. A party leader, supervisor, or professor,
in return for loyalty, protects those subordinate ot him and takes general resp-
onsibility for their interests throughout their entire lives, an obligation that
sometimes even extends to arranging marriages. The corresponding loyalty of the
individual to his patron reinforces his allegiance to the group to which they b-
oth belong. A willingness to cooperate with other members of the group and to s-
upport without qualification the interests of the group in all its external rel-
ations is still a widely respected virtue. The _oyabun-kobun_ creates ladders of
mobility which and individual can ascend, rising as far as abilities permit, so
long as he maintains successful personal ties with a superior in the vertical c-
hannel, the latter requirement usually taking precedence over a need for except-
ional eompetence. As a consequence, there is little horizontal relationship bet-
ween people even within the same profession.

                          English Expidition Overseas

England became unified late in the 15th century. On Bosworth Field, in 1845, He-
nry Tudor put an end to the civil strife of the Wars of the Roses and crowned h-
imself Henry VII. Forcefully bringing recalcitrant nobles to heel, he strengthe-
ned his authority. For the first time in nearly a century, the country had stab-
ility in government and a considerable degree of peace and prosperity. Henry, t-
herefore, could devote his attention to the promotion of commerce. He encouraged
English merchants to enter foreign trade, supported the formation of trading co-
mpanies, and restricted the activities of the foreign merchants in London and B-
ristol, who had monopolized trade. Columbus even sent his brother to England wh-
en he failed to obtain support from the Portuguese or Spanish Kings for his pro-
posal that Cathay could be reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Henry V-
II agreed to finance the voyage and urged Columbus to come at once to England.
But, before the latter left Spain, the Spanish monarchs experienced a change of
heart and supported the voyage that was to give Spain an empire.

Meanwhile, Henry VII never gave up his hope of obatining for England a share of
the rich Eastern trade. British merchants established a trade link with Iceland
about 1490. And, encouraged by news of Columbus' voyage, on March 5, 1496, Henry
VII granted letters-patent to the "well-beloved John Cabot" and his three sons
to sail across the Atlantic to Asia. An Italian-born navigator, Cabot had lived
in England since 1484. As a youth, he had visited the East, and when he arrived
in London he had already decided that an all-water route could be found to the
trading centers there. He may have made a few trips to Iceland before the King
commissioned his trans-Atlantic voyage.

In May of 1497, Cabot left Bristol with a crew of 18 and, after a voyage of 52
days across the North Atlantic, landed on Cape Breton Island and took possession
of the land for Henry VII. From there, he explored several islands in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence and in August returned to England and the praise of Henry VII,
who granted him new letters-patent. When Cabot sailed again, in 1498, he had pe-
rhaps 5 or 6 ships, whose crews totaled some 300 men. The King personally finan-
ced a substantial protion of the expedition's cost. On his second voyage, Cabot
probably explored the North American coast from Newfoundland south of the Delaw-
are of Chesapeake Bays.

Having failed to find the shores of Cathay (China) or Cipango (Japan), the Engl-
ish truned in the opposite direction. Henry VII's son, Henry VIII - better known
for his marital involvements and his break with the Pope - enthusiastically beg-
an to build "a fleet the like of which the world has never seen." John Cabot's
son, Sebastian, became a renowned navigator. After serving Spain for a number of
years, he returned to England and opened the northern sea-land route to Moscow.
He also helped found the company of Merchant-Adventurers, predecessor of the Mu-
scovy Company, and became its president for life.

Thus, for nearly a century, England's interest was diverted from the New World,
and her energies were concentrated on the development of a commercial empire and
a merchant fleet that became second to none in Europe. But John Cabot had given
England a claim to the northern shores of the New World, and in the course of t-
ime the "sea dogs" and other English mariners were to breathe new life into it.

                  Religious Situation in 17th Century England

Not long after the founding of Virginia, other Englishmen established another c-
olony to the north. In 1620, a shipload of religious dissenters, later known as
Pilgrims, debarked from the _Mayflower_ on the western shore of Cape Cod Bay, on
the coast of Massachusetts. The nucleus of the group were Puritan separatists,
part of a congregation of nonconformists of Scrooby parish in Nottinghamshire,
England. Because of the strict enforcement of the religious laws by James I, in
1608-1609 the entire congregation of about 100 had moved to Holland seeking tol-
eration. In 1620, they received permission from the Crown and financial backing
from the London Company to migrate to Virginia. About 35 members of the congreg-
ation chose to do so; they first traveled to England, where they joined another
group of dissenters. The _Mayflower_ carried 101 passengers and a crew of 48. T-
hey were the first Englishmen - but by no means the last - to escape Stuart per-
secution in the New World.

The religious situation in England had grown complicated since Henry VIII separ-
ated the established church from Rome and placed himself at its head. In the la-
st years of his reign, pressure from Protestant reformers forced him to modify
much of the ecclesiastical code. After his death, the regents of his young son
stimulated the Protestant movement. Mary then had attempted to reverse the tide,
but Elizabeth wisely chose a middle course. She instituted moderate reforms in
the Church of England and, though not disposed to tolerance of Protestants, did
not rigorously enforce the regulations that restricted them.

A large group arose that wanted to continue the proess of reform. Gradually they
came to be called Puritans. Those Anglicans who would "purify" the church from
from within were known as conforming Puritans; those favoring stronger measures,
as nonconformists, dissenters, or separatists. Religious disputation was the ra-
ge of the day, when translations of the Bible were first beginning to reach the
hands of the people, who were also stimulated by the controversies that the Ref-
ormation had fostered. Interestingly enough, the version on which the Scrooby P-
ilgrims based their dissent was probably the Bishops' Bible, not the King James
translation used today by most Protestant sects.

By authorizing this magnificent translation, James I undoubtedly hoped to put an
end to dissent; instead, he only quickened it. His other religious policies, wh-
ich grew harsher toward the end of his reign, were also designed to stamp out t-
he heresy that was budding all ove England. The King increased the pressure on
nonconformists and separatists, and churchmen grew more and more intolerant, ev-
en of the conforming Puritans. But the more vigorous the pruning, the healthier
the plant bacame. After James died, in 1625, his son Charles I (1625-49) proved
to be even less tolerant. A bloody revolution cost Charles his throne and his l-
ife, and the Puritan colonies in New England grew rapidly.

                     The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)

President Roosevelt's administration suffered a devastating defeat when, on Jan-
uary 6, 1936, the Agricultural Adjustment Act was declared unconstitutional. New
Deal planners quickly pushed through Congress the Soil Conservation and Domestic
Allotment Act of 1935, our purpose of which was conservation, but which also ai-
med at controlling surpluses by retiring land from production. The law was inte-
nded as a stopgap measure until the administration could formulate a permanent
farm program that would satisfy both the nation's farmers and the Supreme Court.
Roosevelt's landslide victory over London in 1936 obscured the ambivalent nature
of his support in the farm states. Despite extensive government propaganda, many
farmers still refused to participate in the Agricultural Adjustment Administrat-
ion's voluntary production control programs, and the burdensome surpluses of 19-
33 were gone - not the result of the AAA, but a consequence of great droughts.

In February of 1937, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace convened a meeting of farm
leaders to promote the concepte of the ever-normal granary, a policy that would
encourage farmers to store crop surpluses (rather than dump them on the market)
until grain was needed in years of small harvests. The Commodity Credit Corpora-
tion would grant loans to be repaid when the grain was later sold for a reasona-
ble profit. The conference chose a Committee of Eighteen, which drafted a bill,
but the major farm organizations were divided. Since ten of the eighteen members
were also members of the American Farm Bureau Federation, the measure was quick-
ly labeled a Farm Bureau bill, and there were protests from the small, but high-
ly vocal, Farmer's Holiday Association. When debate on the bill began, Roosevelt
himself was vague and elusive and didn't move the proposed legislation into the
"desirable" category until midsummer. In addition, there were demands that the
New Deal's deficit spending be curtailed, and opponents of the bill charged that
the AAA was wasteful and primarily benefited corporations and large-scale farme-
rs.

The Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act had failed to limit agricultur-
al production as the administration had hoped. Farm prices and consumer demand
were high, and many farmers, convinced that the drought had ended the need for
crop controls, refused to participate in the AAA's soil conservation program. W-
ithout direct crop controls, agricultural production skyrocketed in 1937, and by
late summer there was panic in the farm belt that prices would again be driven
down to disastrously low levels. Congressmen began to pressure Roosevelt to pla-
ce a floor under farm prices by making loans through the CCC, but Roosevelt made
such loans contingent upon the willingness of Congress to support the administr-
ation's plan for a new system of crop controls. When the price of cotton began
to drop, Roosevelt's adroit political maneuver finally forced congressional rep-
resentatives from the South to agree to support a bill providing for crop contr-
ols and the ever-normal granary. The following year Congress passed the Agricul-
tural Adjustment Act of 1938.

                                American Indians

In describing the Indians of the various sections of the United States at diffe-
rent stages in their history, some of the factors which account for the their s-
imilarity amid difference can be readily accounted for, others are difficult to
discern.

The basic physical similarity of the Indians from Alaska to Patagonia is explai-
ned by the fact that they all came originally from Asia by way of the Bering St-
rait and the Aleutian Islands into Alaska and then southward. They came in diff-
erent waves, the earliest around 25,000 years ago, the latest probably not long
before American was discovered by Europeans. Because these people all came from
Asia and were therefore drawn from the same pool of Asiatic people, they tended
to look alike. But since the various waves of migration crossed into Alaska at
widely separated times, there were differences among them in their physical cha-
racteristics.

There were also differences in cultural equipment. The earliest arrivals are kn-
own to science only through their simple tools of chipped stone and bone. Despi-
te their limited technical equipment, some of the New Mexico Indians were very
successful big game hunters. Twenty-five thousand years ago they were hunting t-
he woolly mammoth, the giant bison, the ground sloth and the camel, all charact-
eristic animals of the closing phases of the last ice age.

After their arrival from Asia in various waves across the Bering Strait, the ea-
rly peoples in the Americas slowly spread southward into the vast empty spaces
of the two continents. A group of people moving slowly down the Mackenzie River
valley east of the Rockies into the general region of Southern Alberta, then ea-
stward across the northern prairies reaching the wooded country around the upper
Mississippi valley until some final settlement was reached in the Gulf states,
would encounter a wide variety of physical environments. At various stages of s-
uch wanderings they would have to evolve methods of coping with the cold, barre-
n, tundra country of northern Canada; the prairies, cold, treeless but well soc-
ked with large game; then later the completely different flora an fauna of the
Minnesota-Wisconsin-Illinois area, thickly forested and well watered and provid-
ing abundance of small game and wild vegetable foods; then the semi-tropical ch-
aracter of the lower Mississippi country as they neared the Gulf of Mexico. Sin-
ce such a migration would be spread over many centuries, the modification of wh-
atever basic culture they had on their arrival from Asia would be very slow. Yet
the end result would be completely different from their original culture. It wo-
uld also be different from the final culture of a closely allied group who beca-
me separated from them early in their wanderings and whose movements led them i-
nto different types of country. In its final form, the culture of this second g-
roup would have little in common with that of the first except perhaps a contin-
uing resemblance in language and in physical type.

                                  New Liberals

Late in the nineteenth century, land reform emerged as a dominant concern of the
Liberal Party in England. During this time, many prominent thinkers dissented f-
rom mainstream liberal ideology by questioning the justification of individual
ownership. To John Stuart Mill, Henry George, and Herbert Spencer, for example,
land represented something unique among ownable goods as "a thing not made by m-
an, a thing necessary to life, and of which there is not enough for all." With
these attributes - naturalness of origin, absolute scarcity, and centrality to
all productive life-sustaining activity - land and land ownership, it was asser-
ted, could be considered indefensible rights based upon personal labor or achie-
vement.

Prior to the emergence of htese political analysts, the _Laissez-faire_ views of
Adam Smith were the dominant liberal position. Smith asserted that "the interes-
ts of the state requires that land should be as much in commerce as any other g-
ood." The "new liberal" thinking, however, rejected this traditional notion and
attacked the institutions of primogeniture and strict family settlement that en-
abled the landed class to maintain their estates from one generation to the nex-
t. The new liberal ideology encompassed both economic and social goals. They en-
visioned a break with the static conditions of primogeniture and its replacement
with a more egalitarian and morally vigorous society of peasant proprietors.

In addressing the dilemma of land ownership, proponents of the new liberal thin-
king offered several different strategies. Herbert Spencer's proposal sought to
make land the joint property of society in which all land would be confiscated
by the (democratic) state. Individuals might then lease parts of it through com-
petitive bidding. By paying rent, tenants would thus compensate all non-owners
for having relinquished their claim.

John Stuart Mill employed the law of rent to show that increased land values can
not be attributed to the exertions undertaken by owners; most often, rather, su-
ch increases are the function of the "mere progress of wealth and population."
In this _Political Economy_, Mill held that private property is justified only
as the proprietor of land is its improver. Some policies advocated by Mill indl-
uded a special tax on rent, the protection of renants' rights, state land purch-
ases, and measures, however, Mill insisted that present owners were owed compen-
sation. His proposal of a special tax on land pertained to future unearned inco-
me without disturbing past acquisitions.

According to Henry George, another prominent new liberal, virtually all social
and moral ills of modern society could be traced to private ownership of land.
In _Progress and Poverty_, George rejects the inevitability of poverty and depr-
ivation as remedial defects of society. In his view, rent represented not only
unearned income, but a deleterious drain on much of society's earned income that
absorbed the disposable surplus created by society's cooperative efforts. Georg-
e's solution lay in the socialization of rent. He proposed that the community r-
ecapture its entitlement through a special tax on the rental value of ladn; a l-
evy - known as the "single tax" - would eliminate the need for taxing productive
enterprises and would eventually replace all other taxes.

                                 Robert Morris

Merchant Robert Morris was a man of many distinctions. One of the wealthiest in-
dividuals in the Colonies and an economic wizard, he won the accolade "Financier
of the Revolution," yet died penniless and forgotten. He and Roger Sherman were
the only signers of all three of the Nation's basic documents: the Declaration
of Independence, Articles of Confederation, and Constitution. Morris, who turned
down appointment as the first Secretary of the Treasury, also served as a Senat-
or in the First Congress.

Morris was born in or near Liverpool, England, in 1734. At the age of 13, he em-
igrated to Maryland to join his father, a tobacco exporter at Oxford, Md. After
brief schooling at Philadelphia, the youth obtained employment with Thomas and
Charles Willing's well-known shipping firm. In 1754 he became a partner, and for
almost four decades was one of the company's directors as well as one of Philad-
elphia's most influential citizens. Marrying in 1769 at the age of 35, he fathe-
red five sons and two daughters.

During the Stamp Act turmoil in 1765, Morris had joined other merchants in prot-
est, but not until the outbreak of hostilities a decade hence did he fully comm-
it himself to the Revolution. In 1775 the Continental Congress contracted with
his firm to import arms and ammunition; and he was elected to the Pennsylvania
council of safety (1775-76), the committee of correspondernce, the provincial a-
ssembly (1775-76), the State legislature (1776-78), and the Continental Congress
(1775-78). In the latter body, on July 1, 1776, he voted against independence,
which he personally considered premature, but the next day purposely absented h-
imself to facilitate and affirmative ballot by his State.

Morris, a key Member of Congress, specialized in financial affairs and military
procurement. Although he and his firm profited handsomely, had it not been for
his assiduous labors the Continental Army would probably have needed to demobil-
ize. He worked closely with General Washington, wheedled money and supplies from
the States, borrowed money in the face of overwhelming difficulties, and on occ-
asion even obatined personal loans to further the war cause. Immediately follow-
ing his congressional service, Morris sat for two more terms in the Pennsylvania
legislature in the period between 1778 and 1781. During this time, Thomas Paine
and others attacked him for profiteering in Congress, which investigated his ac-
counts and vindicated him. Nevertheless, his reputation slipped.

Morris embarked on the most dramatic phase of his career by accepting the office
of Superintendent of Finance (1781-84) under the Articles of Confederation. Con-
gress, recognizing the perilous state of the Nation's finances and its impotence
to remedy it, granted him dictatorial powers and acquiesced to his condition th-
at he be allowed to continue his private commercial enterprises. He slashed all
governmental and military expenditures, personally purchased Army and Navy supp-
lies, tightened accounting procedures, prodded the States to fulfill quotas of
money and supplies, and when necessary strained his personal credit by issuing
notes over his own signature or borrowing from friends.

To finance Washington's Yorktown campaign in 1781, in addition ot the above tec-
hniques Morris obtained a sizable loan from France. He used part of it, along w-
ith some of his own fortune, to organize the Bank of North America, chartered t-
hat December. The first Government-incorporated bank in the United States, it a-
ided war financing.

================================================================================

                                  King Alfred

King Alfred had occupied and fortified London in 886, and during the subsequent
years he began construction of his system of _burhs_, or fortresses, throughout
Wessex. The surrounding villages and estates were held responsible for providing
men to defend the burhs in numbers proportionate to the amount of land their fa-
rmers cultivated. Though not completed until during the reign of Alfred's son E-
dward, this system of fortresses did much to hamper the Danish invaders during
the last great war of Alfred's reign.

This war began in 893, when Danish _Vikings_ who had been repelled from Germany
invaded England and joined forces with the by then well-established English Dan-
es. For three years, Alfred and Ethelred of Mercia fought the Danes throughout
southern England. On numerous occasions, Alfred's strategic skills turned away
Danish advances, as when he marched on London unexpectedly during the harvest s-
eason of 894 to prevent the Danes from seizing the crops for winter sustenance
and subsequently clinched the triumph by a fortress-and-dam blockade of the Tha-
mes. In 896, huge longboats of a new design devised by Alfred decimated and sca-
ttered a force of Danish raiding ships. By 897, the second invasion had been so-
undly defeated. This ended Alfred's military career, since the Danes did not re-
open their attempts to conquer Wessex until after Alfred's death in 899.

The technique of combining imaginative innovations with highly practical admini-
strative measures that served Alfred well as a general can also be seen in the
record of his nonmilitary career. The methodical nature evidenced by the system
of burhs is shown in the organization of his court. Officeholders were divided
into three groups that served rotating one-month shifts, thus freeing them to t-
end their farmlands two months out of every three. (Alfred had introduced a sim-
ilar policy for his soldires, largely eliminating the common problem of an army
deserting in mid-campaign at planting or harvest time.) Alfred's finances were
also systematized, with revenues divided into two shares for secular and religi-
ous purposes. Each share in turn was methodically subdivided into a number of p-
replanned expenditure categories.

Alfred won a name as a strict and conscientious overseer of the _ealdormen_, re-
eves and others with judicial functions. His own reputation as a judge is sugge-
sted by a comment in a charter issued during his son's reign. In upholding one
of Alfred's decisions, the anonymous author of the charter asked rhetorically,
"When would any claim be decided if every judgment which Alfred made were in di-
spute?"

Alfred's major contribution to the legal system of his day was his systematizat-
ion of the law code. Alfred's law book was compiled, significantly, from laws p-
reviously issued not only by Alfred's own predecessor Ine (king of Wessex 688-7-
26) but also by Offa of Mercia and Ethelbert of Kent. The use of all three sour-
ces reflects the increased English unity created by the pressure of the Danish
invasions and by Alfred's own unique prestige and power.

================================================================================

                         America's Drift to World War I

Meanwhile, the problem of neutral rights on the seas revived to plague America's
relations with the belligerents. One of the German justifications for its shoot-
on-sight policy was, as we have seen the fragility of the U-boat and its vulner-
ability to even armed merchant vessels. To deal with this problem, in early 1916
Lansing proposed a modus vivendi: if the Allies agreed to disarm their merchant
ships, the Germans would agree to the principle, suspended but not yet formally
acknowledged, that their submarines would not attack such vessels without warni-
ng and withou protecting the safety of civilians. In effect, the submarine would
function as a surface cruiser and observe the rules of naval warfare laid down
in past years.

Unwilling to surrender what they considered a well-established right to arm sur-
face vessels in exchange for a German concession to abide by existing internati-
onal law, the British rejected the proposal immediately. Faced with this hostile
response, Lansing quickly dropped the modusvivendi proposal. Unfortunately, he
had opened a Pandora's box. In explaining it to the German government, Lansing
had implied that the American government regarded Allied armed merchant vessels
as warships. This had been the German position all along, and they eagerly seiz-
ed on the opening the Americans had created. On February 10 the kaiser's govern-
ment informed the American State Department that beginning on February 29, Germ-
an U-boats would resume their attacks on _armed_ merchant vessels without prior
warning. In effect, the truce ushered in by the _Arabic_ pledge was over.

The sequence of events alarmed the pacifists and the isolationists. The Wilson
administration, by dropping the modus vivendi, seemed to be saying that it acce-
pted the British position that armed merchant vessels were not warships. If this
were so, then by the administration's interpretation, Americans would have the
right to travel on such vessels. Since the Germans now intended to attack them
on sight, Wilson was almost guaranteeing a collision with Germany. Hoping to he-
ad off such a confrontation, Representative Jeff Mclemore of Texas and Senator
Thomas P. Gore of Oklahoma introduced resolutions forbidding American travel on
armed or _contraband_-carrying ships. Wilson interpreted this as a challenge to
his leadership in foreign affairs and a cowardly surrender of American rights.
"For my own part," he wrote the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, "I cannot consent to any abridgement of the rights of American citizens in
any respect... Once accept a single abatement of rights, and many other humilia-
tions would certainly follow, and the whole fine fabric of international law mi-
ght crumble under our hands piece by piece." Congress backed down under the Pre-
sident's pressure and tabled the Gore-Mclemore resolutions. Wilson's victory ov-
er Congress and the peace groups marked the further drift to war.

                        The Early North American Indians

Although humans likely entered the New World as early as 20,000 to 40,000 years
ago, the first solid evidence of their presence, which was found in the Midwest,
dates from the Paleo-Indian period (10,000 to 8,000 B.C.). By the beginning of
this period, humans had spread throughout both continents of the Western Hemisp-
here and had developed distinctive tool kits for exploiting the environment. Ar-
chaeological data suggest that subsistence activities centered around hunting l-
arge late-Pleistocene mammals, such as bison, mammoth, and mastodon. This explo-
itative pattern is frequently referred to as the big-game hunting tradition. It
is probable that small game animals and plant resources also played an importan-
t, if not dominant, part in the subsistence activities during this period, but
there is currently little archaeological evidence to substantiate this proposit-
ion. Social groups probably consisted of small bands that wandered over large a-
reas in pursuit of game and other scattered resources.

The transition from Paleo-Indian to Archaic occured gradually throughout the ea-
stern woodlands and is generally correlated with the retreat of the glaciers as
well as with the concomitant change in the kinds and distributions of plant and
animal resources. Dates assigned to the Archaic period range between approximat-
ely 8000 B.C. and 1000 B.C. This long period can be further subdivided into thr-
ee parts: the Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000 to 2000 B-
.C.), and Late Archaic (2000 to 1000 B.C.).

Archaic subsistence activities focused on gathering from localized areas a wide
range of wild resources, such as large and small mammals, birds, fish, nuts, and
seeds. Through time, Archaic populations developed from small, scattered groups
scavenging resources over a wide area to larger groups forming greater regional
populations that occupied more limited territories. Groups apparently moved from
place to place to collect a variety of localized resources in a seasonal round.
The Archaic period marks the beginning of the development of regional cultural
traditions that persist into later times throughout the eastern woodlands.

During the Early Archaic period, sites tend to be small and scattered, much like
those of the Paleo-Indian period. Sites occur primarily in upland situations, b-
ut Early Archaic remains have also been found in rock shelters and along high r-
iver terraces. Sites located in upland contexts are frequently concentrated near
secondary stream valleys along major rivers. The variety of site locations evid-
ently reflects seasonal shifts of settlements during the Early Archaic period.
However, in some areas, such as the lower Mississippi Valley, where Early Archa-
ic sites are located in bottomland situations, variation in settlement type may
be more a reflection of functional differences than of seasonal shifts.

During the Middle Archaic period, subsistence emphasis shifts toward more inten-
sive utilization of localized resources, with a stress on exploiting forest and
riverine contexts. Data from the lower Illinois River Valley suggest that a bro-
ad spectrum of fauna was being taken along with a limited number of highly prod-
uctive floral resources, such as hickory nuts. The appearance of the grinding s-
tone in the tool inventory indicates that nuts and seeds had become an important
part of the subsistence base. The beginning of the manufacture of ground-stone
tools, such as axes, suggests to some investigators that wood working was also
an important acivity. Base camps with permanent habitation structures appear as
part of the settlement system and are apparently occupied for most, if not all,
of a year. The earliest burials in Illinois also occur during this period.

                                 Horse Raiding

From the time they first acquired the horse in the eighteenth century, the three
tribes of the Blackfeet nation - Blackfeet, Bloods, and Peigans - turned to hor-
se raiding as one of their main vocations. Any of their enemies were possible p-
rey for small war parties, but the transmountain tribes, such as the Nez Perce,
Flathead, and Shoshone, were particular targets because of their fine breed of
horses.

Throughout the nomadic years, war parties from the Balckfeet were usually organ-
ized for one of two purposes. Either they were formed to capture horses from en-
emy tribes or they went out to revenge an attack suffered by their own people.
The horse-raiding expeditions were often made up of small groups of young warri-
ors from different camps. Their party had no permanent organization but was usu-
ally formed for a single raid and then disbanded. Quite often it would be led by
and experienced older warrior, while young untried boys went along as servants
to learn the art of horse raiding. The revenge party, on the other hand, was us-
ually a large, well-organized group of warriors who were bent on killing their
enemies. Their victims did not have to be the same persons who had attacked the-
m; more often, the victims were not even from the same tribe. The need for reve-
nge would be satisfied in any case.

The taking of human life was not usually one of hte objectives of a horse raid.
The war party preferred to creep into enemy territory undetected, take their bo-
oty of horses, and ruturn to their own camps. The enemy herds grazing on the pr-
airie were fairly easy to seize, but the prized buffalo runners and racehorses
were usually kept under closer guard within the camp. These horses were tied to
the owner's tepee - or, in some cases, even to the owner's wrist - by a long ro-
pe. It was considered a great feat if a raider could successfully creep into ca-
mp, cut this rope, and take the animal.

Of course, many raiding parties were discovered in enemy territory and treated
unmercifully. But the Blackfeet were as brave in battle as they were stealthful
in raiding. Many heroic tales among these tribes tell of warriors who fought th-
eir way out of such perilous situations.

The intertribal raiding for horses began to wane in the 1880s. The last recorded
raid in which a human life was taken occurred in 1889, when a war party of Bloo-
ds took forty horses from the Crow Indians. While returning north to their own
reservation, they were suddenly attacked by Assiniboine Indians and managed to
kill and scalp  at least one of their attackers.

Among the Northern Blackfeet, the last recorded raid also took place in 1889, w-
hen two warriors returned to their camps with twelve horses taken in Montana. T-
hese were seized by Head Chief Crowfoot and turned over to the Mounted Police.

The last raid among the Montana Blackfeet seems to have occurred as late as 189-
2. The leader in this case was White Quiver, perhaps the greatest of all Blackf-
oot raiders. He stood trial before the Indian Court but, having turned over four
horses alleged to have been stolen from the Crows, was released for lack of evi-
dence.

By this time, the country between the various Indian reservations was becoming
too heavily populated for the raiders to travel undetected. Their only recourse
was to turn their attention to horses of ranchers and farmers. For the next sev-
eral yers, young men unwilling to give up their old customs conducted raids aga-
inst the whites, but they met with little success. Lack of sympathy from the ch-
iefs, increased military and police protection, and the expanding white populat-
ion were all factors that finally ended the horse-raiding careers of the Blackf-
eet.

================================================================================

                              Blacks in Civil War

In the 1930s and 40s, the few historians who discussed the role of Black people
in the American Revolution laid great stress on their contributions to the cause
of independence. Such treatments noted that in the northern colonies, Black peo-
ple petitioned legislatures for freedom as early as 1775, citing the doctrine of
natural rights espoused by the White colonists. Black soldiers joined the first
militias, serving with distinction at Lexington and Concord. These historians d-
id not hesitate to point out that Congress initially forbade recruiting any Bla-
ck soldiers, slave or free, even though Washington warned that the Massachusetts
veterans, "very much dissatisfied at being discarded," might enlist under the B-
ritish. (Only after 1777 did several northern states, facing severe recruiting
problems, promise to free slaves who entered Colonial military service; southern
states rejected similar proposals.) But despite their candor in describing the
ambiguities of White response, these earlier historical accounts remained one-s-
ided; they tended simply to stamp Black people with behavior the historians con-
sidered "good" (support for American independence) and to ignore the distinctne-
ss of Black interests as compared to those of the White colonists.

Later, historians such as Quarles and Mullin, among others balanced the picture
by noting the phenomenon of Black Loyalism. As early as November 1775, the royal
governor of Virginia raised a militia of several hundred escaped slaves. The Br-
itish high command, initially reluctant to foreclose chances for reconciliation
with the Colonies, later saw the value of depleting the rebels' labor force and
creating a threat of insurrection in their rear. The Philipsburg Proclamation,
issued in 1779, guaranteed "every Negro who shall desert the Rebel Standard...
full security to follow within these lines any occupation which he [sic] shall
think proper." Some one-fifth of the slave population ultimately threw in their
lot with the losers. The British settled three thousand of these Loyalists in N-
ova Scotia after the war, refusing demands by the victors for their return.

The work of Quarles, Mullin, and others has made possible a more sophisticated
picture of the Black response to White rebellion. Rather naively supporting one
side or the other in the conflict, Black people would seem to have taken advant-
age of the limited opportunities for emancipation that the war brought, from wh-
atever quarter they came. Nevertheless, we would be well advised not to settle
for new stereotypes when we have scarcely begun to look at the direct testimony
of colonial Black people themselves. Historians of such mainly-White groups as
the colonial merchant seamen have shown that they left behind rich source mater-
ial despite the general lack of written memoirs; surely the same is true for Bl-
ack people.

                          Russians in German Uniforms

No sooner had the British forces in June 1944 carried out their part in the All-
ied invasion of Germany than they were faced with the fact that among the priso-
ners of war captured there were Russians in German uniforms. By the time the war
in Europe ended, between two and three million Soviet citizens had passed throu-
gh Allied hands. This extraordinary situation, certainly never before known in
the history of war, was the consequence of the policy of both the Soviet and the
German regimes. On the Soviet side, the very existence of prisoners of war was
not recognized: the Soviet government refused to adhere to the Geneva Conventio-
n, and washed its hands of the millions who fell into German power.

The Germans, in turn, treated their Soviet prisoners with such callous brutality
that only a relatively small number of them survived. For a Soviet prisoner in
German hands to enlist in the German armed forces was about the only way open to
him of saving his life. There were also Soviet citizens whose hatred of the Com-
munist regime was so strong that they were prepared to fight alongside the Germ-
ans in order to overthrow Stalin: nominally headed by General Andrey Vlasov, th-
ey saw little combat until the end of the war, largely because of Hitler's susp-
icion of Vlasov's claims to maintain his political independence of the National
Socialist regime even as a prisoner of war. There were also some other combat u-
nits composed of Russians, some of them noted for their savagery. Then there we-
re hordes of civilians in German hands - wome compulsorily swept into the German
labor mobilization drive, many more borne along the wave of the German retreat
from Russia and thereafter drafted for labor duties. These civilians included m-
any women and children.

The problem facing the British government from the outset was what policy to ad-
opt toward this mass of humanity that did not fall into any of the accepted cat-
egories thrown up by war. Quite apart from the logistic problems, there existed
a well-established tradition in Britain which refused to repatriate against the-
ir will people who found themselves in British hands and the nature of whose re-
ception by their own government was, to say the least, dubious. The first incli-
nation of the Cabinet - to send all captured Russians back to the Soviet Union -
was challenged by the minister of economic warfare, Lord Selborne, who was moved
by the fact that the Russians in British hands had only volunteered to serve in
German uniforms as an alternative to certain death; and that it would therefore
be inhuman to send them back to be shot or to suffer long periods of forced lab-
or. Winston Churchill was also swayed by this argument.

================================================================================

                          U.S. and the First World War

War and change - political and economic foremost, but social and cultural not f-
ar behind - have been linked in America from the beginning. War was the necessa-
ry factor in the birth of the new American republic, as it has been in the birth
of every political state known to us in history. War, chiefly the Civil War, in
U.S. history has been a vital force in the rise of industrial capitalism, in the
change of America from a dominantly agrarian and pastoral country to one chiefly
manufacturing in nature. War, in focusing the mind of a country, stimulates inv-
entions, discoveries, and fresh adaptations. Despite its manifest illeffects, w-
ar, by the simple fact of the intellectual and social changes it instigates, yi-
elds results which are tonics to advancement.

By all odds, the most important war in U.S. history, the war that released the
greatest number and diversity of changes in American life, was the Great War, t-
he war that began in Europe in August 1914 and engulfed the United States in Ap-
ril 1917. Great changes in America were immediate.

In large measure these changes reflected a release from the sense of isolation,
insularity, and exceptionalism that had suffused so much of the American mind d-
uring the nineteenth century. The early Puritans had seen their new land as a "
city upon a hill" with the eyes of the world on it. It was not proper for the N-
ew World to go to the Old for its edification; what was proper was for the Old
World, grown feeble and hidebound, to come to America for inspiration. A great
deal of that state of mind entered into what Tocqueville called the "American R-
eligion," a religion compounded of Puritanism and ecstatic nationalism.

What we think of today as modernity - in manners and morals as well as ideas and
mechanical things - came into full-blown existence in Europe in the final part
of the nineteenth century, its centers such cities as London, Paris, and Vienna.
In contrast America was a "closed" society, one steeped in conventionality and
also in a struggle for identity. This was how many Europeans saw America and it
was emphatically how certain somewhat more sophisticated Americans saw themselv-
es. The grand tour was a veritable obligation of better-off, ambitious, and edu-
cated Americans - the tour being, of course, of Europe.

Possibly the passage of American values, ideas, and styles from "closed" to "op-
en," from the isolated to the cosmopolitan society, would have taken place, alb-
eit more slowly, had there been no transatlantic war of 1914-1918. We can't be
sure. What we do know is that the war, and America's entrance into it, gave dyn-
amic impact to the processes of secularization, individualization, and other ki-
nds of social-psychological change which so drastically changed this country fr-
om the America of the turn of the century to the America of the 1920s.

================================================================================

                     The Populist Movement and McCarthyism

Historians have long known that there were two sides to the Populist movement of
the 1890s: a progressive side, embodying the protests of farmers against big bu-
siness, and a darker side, marked by a distrust of Easterners, immigrants, and
intellectuals. In the 1950s, one school of U.S. social thinkers constructed a p-
arallel between this dark side of Populism and the contemporary anti-Communist
crusade spearcheaded by Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, which attacked liber-
alism, Eastern intellectuals, and civil liberties in general. To Seymour Martin
Lipset, McCarthyism represented "the sour dregs of Populism"; to Edward Shils,
McCarthyism, like Populism, exemplified "the ambiguous American impulse toward
'direct democracy'".

Noting that McCarthyism and Populism had both found their strongest support in
the agrarian Midwest, Lipset argued that votes who backed agrarian protest move-
ments during earlier economic crises had supported McCarthy in the post-World W-
ar II period of prosperity. "It would be interesting to know," Lipset wrote, "w-
hat percentage of those who supported the isolationist but progressive Bob La F-
ollette in Wisconsin now backs McCarthy." But, in the eyes of these writers, the
appeal of McCarthyism extended beyond the agrarian base of Populism to include
urban groups such as industrial workers. Lipset claimed that "the lower classes,
especially the workers" had backed McCarthy. In a more sweeping fashion, Lewis
Feuer claimed that "it was the American lower classes... who gave their overwhe-
lming support to the attacks in recent years on civil liberties."

Writing a few years later, political scientist Michael Paul Rogin challenged th-
ese superficially plausible notions, contending that they merely embodied the w-
riters' own assumptions about the supposed intolerance of lower class groups, r-
ather than a valid interpretation of McCarthyism. Rogin critically examined the-
ir assertions by the simple method of testing them against the evidence. He tes-
ted Lipset's claims about the continuity of McCarthyism and earlier agrarian pr-
otest movements by breaking down statewide voting statistics on a county-by-cou-
nty and precinct-by-precinct basis. He found that Wisconsin counties that had v-
oted strongly for Progressives before World War II did not support McCarthy; Mc-
Carthy's support was concentrated in his home region and in ethnic German areas
that had been traditionally conservative. The old Progressive vote had in fact
gone to McCarthy's opponents, the Democrats.

To test Lipset's generalizations about McCarthy's support among lower class gro-
ups, Rogin attempted to determine whether industrial workers had, in fact, back-
ed McCarthy. Correlating income and employment statistics with voting records,
Rogin found that the greater the employment in industry in a given Wisconsin co-
unty, the lower was McCarthy's share of the vote. Rogin concluded that the thes-
is of "McCarthyism as Populism" should be judged "not as the product of science
but as a venture into conservative political theory".

================================================================================

                   American Society in the Eighteenth Century

American society in the eighteenth century operated according to the logic of a
closed system. Whatever the scope of concern - a family, a community, a new nat-
ion, an empire - the guiding assumptions in each case established a framework of
rules or principles, a container of truth that defined relationships and conseq-
uences inside its bounds. Sometimes the source of these principles lay in heave-
nly writ, sometimes in natural law, more often in some blend of the sacred and
the secular. Always, however, they existed above and prior to human actions, and
therefore they always stood ready as a measure of virtue in the present and a b-
asis for prescriptions about the future. Rarely were these truths considered in-
comprehensible. Although ordinary citizens might require a learned elite to exp-
lain them, their meaning nevertheless fell within the ken of human reason. Henc-
e, everyone was obligated to adapt their ways to these overarching rules, as th-
ey were commonly understood, and anyone could reasonably judge others, wherever
they lived, by their degree of conformity to the same immutable principles.

Applying these principles was a delicate art that demanded quite different skil-
ls in a familiar, local setting than in a broad, impersonal one. The center of
eighteenth-century society was the family in a community. Across an impressive
American diversity, family and community interconnected in a great many forms,
ranging from Mennonite settlements where the community almost swallowed its fam-
ilies to kinship systems in South Carolina and Virginia with a very loose attac-
hment to a county seat or a region. Every variation, however, set family units
to manage the particulars of everyday life in a manner that constrained each un-
it by the values all of them held in common. These controls, in turn, were rein-
forced by an assumption of the community's permanence. People expected to spend
a lifetime with the same faces, the same family names, the same pattern of inst-
itutions, the same routines of work and pleasure, and as they judged these inti-
mate relations by their superstructure of truths, they drew upon an accretion of
knowledge about individuals and families and customary ways to estimate, day by
day, the state of their immediate society.

The farther their vision extended beyond the community however, the more people
relied upon an explicit demonstration that the affairs concerning them in a wid-
er environment were actually abiding by the correct principles. An obsession wi-
th the exact pribileges of a colonial legislature and the precise extent of Bri-
tain's imperial power, the specifics of a state constitution and the absolute n-
ecessity of a federal one, all expressed this urge for a careful articulation as
proof that the right relationship with external powers did indeed prevail. Unli-
ke the calculations of a community's health, which gave significance to everybo-
dy's accumulated knowledge about their neighbors and their traditions, these br-
oad applications of principle belonged almost exclusively to an elite. The more
a wider world affected the life of a community, the more its members looked to
an elite for mediation - to explain distant events, to negotiate with distant a-
uthorities. During times of crisis relationships inside a community that might
otherwise have been quite fluid tended to solidify behind a very few leaders in
order to meet an external danger.

                           The Study of Negro History

Paralleling the growth of interest among professional historians during the ear-
ly 1960s was a simultaneous groundswell of popular interest in the Afro-American
past that was directly stimulated by the drama of the protest movement. Sensing
the "Negro Mood," the journalist Lerone Bennett wrote a series of articles on A-
fro-American history for _Ebony_ and soon after brought them together in his po-
pular volume, _Before the Mayflower_ (1962). As the nonviolent direct action mo-
vement attained its crest in 1963-64, movement activists introduced black histo-
ry units into the curricula of the "freedom schools" that accompanied the school
integration boycotts. Meanwhile, boards of education began to address themselves
to "the racial imbalance and neutralism of pusillanimous textbooks designed to
appeal to Southern as well as Northern school adoption committees." In 1964 New
York City's school board published _The Negro in American History_; Detroit's s-
ocial studies teachers produced _The Struggle for Freedom and Rights: Basic Fac-
ts about the Negro in American History_. Franklin, surveying the activities amo-
ng publishers, teachers, and school boards, called these beginnings of curricul-
um revision "one of the most significant byproducts of the current Civil Rights
Revolution".

The relationship between these developments at the grass roots level and what w-
as occurring in the scholarly world is of course indirect. Yet given the context
of of social change in the early 1960s, Negro history was now the object of unp-
recedented attention among wide segments of the American population, black and
white. In academe nothing demonstrated this growing legitimacy of black history
better than the way in which certain scholars of both races, who had previously
been ambivalent about being identified as specialists in the field, now reversed
themselves.

Thus Frenise Logan, returning to an academic career, decided to attempt to publ-
ish his doctoral dissertation on blacks in late nineteenth-century North Caroli-
na. A 1960 award encouraged him to do further research, and his expanded _The N-
egro in North Carolina_, 1876-1894 appeared in 1964. It is true that as late as
1963 a white professor advised John W.Blassingame to avoid black history if he
wanted to have "a future in the historical profession". Yet more indicative of
how things were going was that 1964-65 marked a turning point for two of Kenneth
Stamp's former students - Nathan Huggins and Leon Litwack. The changing intelle-
ctual milieu seems to have permitted Huggins, whose original intention of speci-
alizing in African and Afro-American history had been overruled by practical co-
ncerns, to move into what became his long-range commitment to the field. By 1965
when his interest in intellectual history found expression in the idea of doing
a book on the Harlem Renaissance, the factors that earlier would have discourag-
ed him from such a study had dissipated. For Litwack the return to Negro history
was an especially vivid experience, and he recalls the day he spoke at the Univ-
ersity of Rochester, lecturing on Jacksonian democracy. Some students in the au-
dience, sensing that his heart was just not in that topic, urged him to underta-
ke research once again in the field to which he had already contributed so sign-
ificantly. He settled on the study that became _Been in the Storm So Long_ (1979
). In short, both Huggins and Litwack now left able to dismiss the professional
considerations that had loomed so large in their earlier decision to work in ot-
her specialties and to identify themselves with what had hitherto been a margin-
al field of inquiry.

================================================================================

                   Marx and Durkheim as Applied Sociologists

It is easy to accept Freud as an applied scientist, and, indeed he is widely re-
garded as the twentieth century's master clinician. However, in viewing Marx as
an applied social scientist the stance needed is that of a Machiavellian operat-
ionalism. The objective is neither to bury nor to praise him. The assumption is
simply that he is better understood for being understood as an applied sociolog-
ist. This is in part the clear implication of Marx's _Theses on Feurbach_, which
culminate in the resounding 11th thesis: "The philosophers have only interpreted
the world in different ways; the point, however, is to change it." This would s-
eem to be the tacit creed of applied scientists everywhere.

Marx was no Faustian, concerned solely with understanding society, but a Promet-
hean who sought to understand it well enough to influence and to change it. He
was centrally concerned with the social problems of a lay group, the proletaria-
t, and there can be little doubt that his work is motivated by an effort to red-
uce their suffering, as he saw it. His diagnosis was that theri increasing mise-
ry and alienation engendered endemic class struggle; his prognossis claimed that
this would culminate in revolution; his therapeutic prescription was class cons-
ciousness and active struggle.

Here, as in assessing Durkheim or Freud, the issue is not whether this analysis
is empirically correct or scientifically adequate. Furthermore, whether or not
this formulation seems to eviscerate Marx's revolutionary core, as critics on t-
he left may charge, or whether the formulation provides Marx with a new veneer
of academic respectability, as critics on the right may allege, is entirely irr-
elevant from the present standpoint. Insofar as Marx's or any other social scie-
ntist's work conforms to a generalized model of applied social science, insofar
as it is professionally oriented to the values and social problems of laymen in
his society, he may be treated as an applied social scientist.

Despite Durkheim's intellectualistic proclivities and rationalistic pathos, he
was too much the product of European turbulence to turn his back on the travail
of his culture. "Why strive for knowledge of reality, if this knowledge cannot
aid us in life," he asked. "Social science," he said, "can provide us with rules
of action for the future." Durkheim, like Marx, conceived of science as an agen-
cy of social action, and like him was professionally oriented to the values and
problems of laymen in his society. Unless one sees that Durkheim was in some pa-
rt an applied social scientist, it is impossible to understand why he concludes
his monumental study of _Suicide_ with a chapter on "Practical Consequences," a-
nd why, in the _Division of Labor_, he proposes a specific remedy for anomie.

Durkheim is today widely regarded as a model of theoretic and methodologic soph-
istication, and is thus usually seen only in his capacity as a pure social scie-
ntist. Surely this is an incomplete view of the man who regarded the _practical_
effectiveness of a science as its principal justification. To be more fully und-
erstood, Durkheim also needs to be seen as an applied sociologist. His interest
in religious beliefs and organization, in crime and penology, in educational me-
thods and organization, in suicide and anomie, are not casually chosen problem
areas. Nor did he select them only because they provide occasions for the devel-
opment of his theoretical orientation. These areas were in his time, as they are
today, problems of indigenous interest to applied sociologists in Western socie-
ty, precisely because of their practical significance.

================================================================================

                        Karl Marx's Theory and Practice

With Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx in 1848 published the _Communist Manifesto_, c-
alling upon the masses to rise and throw off their economic chains. His maturer
theories of society were later elaborated in his large and abstruse work _Das C-
apital_. Starting as a non-violent revolutionist, he ended life as a major soci-
al theorist more or less sympathetic with violent revolution, if such became ne-
cessary in order to change the social system which he believed to be frankly pr-
edatory upon the masses.

On the theoretical side, Marx set up the doctrine of surplus value as the chief
element in capitalistic exploitation. According to this theory, the ruling clas-
ses no longer employed military force primarily as a means to plundering the pe-
ople. Instead, they used their control over employment and working conditions u-
nder the bourgeois capitalistic system for this purpose, paying only a bare sub-
sistence wage to the worker while they appropriated all surplus values in the p-
roductive process. He further taught that the strategic disadvantage of the wor-
ker in industry prevented him from obtaining a fairer share of the earnings by
bargaining methods and drove him to revolutionary procedures as a means to esta-
blishing his economic and social rights. This revolution might be peacefully co-
nsummated by parliamentary procedures if the people prepared themselves for pol-
itical action by mastering the materialistic interpretation of history and by o-
rganizing politically for the final event. It was his belief that the aggressio-
ns of the capitalist class would eventually destroy the middle class and take o-
ver all their sources of income by a process of capitalistic absorption of indu-
stry - a process which has failed to occur in most countries.

With minor exceptions, Marx's social philosophy is now generally accepted by le-
ftwing labor movements in many countries, but rejected by centrist labor groups,
especially those in the United States. In Russia and other Eastern European cou-
ntries, however, Socialist leaders adopted the methods of violent revolution be-
cause of the opposition of the ruling classes. Yet, many now hold that the pres-
ent Communist regime in Russia and her satellite countries is no longer a prole-
tarian movement based on Marxist social and political theory, but a camouflaged
imperialistic effort to dominate the world in the interest of a new ruling clas-
s.

It is important, however, that those who wish to approach Marx as a teacher sho-
uld not be "buffaloed" by his philosophic approach. They are very likely to in
these days, because those most interested in propagating the ideas of Marx, the
Russian Bolsheviks, have swallowed down his Hegelian philosophy along with his
science of revolutionary engineering, and they look upon us irreverent peoples
who presume to meditate social and even revolutionary problems without making o-
ur obeisance to the mysteries of Dialectic Materialism, as a species of unredee-
med and well-high unredeemable barbarians. They are right in scorning our ignor-
ance of the scientific ideas of Karl Marx and our indifference to them. They are
wrong in scorning our distaste for having practical programs presented in the f-
orm of system of philosophy. In that we simply represent a more progressive int-
ellectual culture than that in which Marx received his education - a culture fa-
rther emerged from the dominance of religious attitudes.

                             Liberties of Citizens

In the long run, a goverment will always encroach upon freedom to the extent to
which it has the power to do so; this is almost a natural law of politics, sinc-
e, whatever the intentions of the people who exercise political power, the sheer
momentum of government leads to a constant pressure upon the liberties of the c-
itizen. But in many countries society has responded by throwing up its own defe-
nses in the shape of social classes or organized corporations which, enjoying e-
conomic power and popular support, have been able to set limits to the scope of
action of the executive. Such, for example, in England was the origin of all our
liberties - won from government by the stand first of the feudal nobility, then
of churches and political parties, and latterly of trade unions, commercial org-
anizations, and the societies for promoting various causes. Even in European la-
nds which were arbitrarily ruled, the powers of the monarchy, though absolute in
theory, were in their exercise checked in a similar fashion. Indeed the fascist
dictatorships of today are the first truly tyrannical governments which Western
Europe has known for centuries, and they have been rendered possible only becau-
se on coming to power they destroyed all forms of social organization which were
in any way rivals to the state.

================================================================================

                     Retaining a Representative Government

When a people have no sufficient value for, and attachment to, a representative
constitution, they have next-to-no chance of retaining it. Representative insti-
tutions necessarily depend for their permanence upon the readiness of the people
to fight for them in case of their being endangered. If too little valued for t-
his, they are almost sure to overthrow, as soon as the head of the government,
or any party leader who can muster a force for a _coup de main_, is willing to
run some small risk for absolute power.

These considerations relate the first two causes of failure in a representative
government. The third is, when the people lack either the will or the capacity
to fulfill the part which belongs to them in a representative constitution.

When nobody, or only some small fraction, feels the degree of interest in the g-
eneral affairs of the state necessary to the formation of a public opinion, the
electors will seldom make any use of the right of suffrage but to serve their p-
rivate interest, or the interest of their locality, or of someone with whom they
are connected as adherents or dependents. The small class who, in this state of
public feeling, gain the command of the representative body, for the most part
use it solely as a means of seeking their fortune.

================================================================================

                              Aggregated Policies

Because some resources must be allocated at the national level, we have created
policies which reflect the aggregated attributes of our society. The federal bu-
dget determines the proportion of federal resources to be invested in social we-
lfare programs and how these resources are distributed among competing programs.
This budget is arrived at through a reiterative aggregative political process w-
hich mediates the claims of groups interested in health, education, welfare, and
so on, thus socializing the continuing conflict generated by their separate asp-
irations. The test of whether a policy is "good" under this system is whether it
can marshal sufficient legitimacy and consent to provide a basis for cohesion a-
nd action. Technical criteria may play a role in the process, but the ultimate
criteria are political and social.

Whether a policy that is "good" in the aggregate sense is also "good" for a par-
ticular person, however, is a different matter. If everyone had identical attri-
butes, these criteria of goodness would produce identical outcomes. With any de-
gree of complexity or change, however, these criteria will always produce diffe-
rent outcomes. Any policy negotiated to attain an aggregate correctness will be
wrong for every individual to whom the policy applies. The less a person confor-
ms to the aggregate, the more wrong it will be.

When a policy is not working, we normally assume that the policy is right in fo-
rm but wrong in content. It had failed because insufficient intelligence has in-
formed its construction or insufficient energy its implementation. We proceed to
replace the old policy by a new one of the same form. This buys time, since some
time must elapse before the new policy can fully display the same set of sympto-
ms of failure as the old. We thus continue to invest our time, energy, and other
resources as if every new discovery of a nonworking policy is a surprise, and a
surprise that can be corrected with some reorganized model. But if policies bas-
ed on complex, aggregated information are always wrong with respect to the pref-
erences of every person to whom they apply, we should concentrate on limiting s-
uch policies to minima or "floors". Rather than trying for better policies, we
should try for fewer policies or more limited aggregated ones. Such limitations
could be designed to produce policies as spare and minimal as possible, for the
resources not consumed in their operation would then be usable in nonaggregativ-
e, person-specific ways - that is, in a disaggregated fashion. This will require
more than just strengthened "local" capacity; it will require the development of
new procefures, institutions, roles, and expectations.

================================================================================

                                Burnham's Theory

Most thinkers have distinguished three political entities: the individual, soci-
ety, and the state. It is normal to begin with the individual and then to consi-
der society as the embodiment of his nature as social being. Thus, the individu-
al is considered to be both logically and historically prior to society and to
the state. But in James Burnham's vision of the future state, the logical prior-
ity of the individual over the state is inverted. Burham changed his mind on ma-
ny points of detail between one book and the next, primarily because he thought
that what was happening in national and world take didn't move far from the ver-
sion of it he gave in _The Managerial Revolution_. In that book he predicted th-
at the weaknesses of capitalism would eventually prove fatal, but the downfall
of capitalism would not be the victory the proletariat followed by a Marxist pa-
radise. Capitalism would be replaced by autocracy even more extreme than that in
Stalin's Russia. Under this autocracy, the instruments of production would be c-
ontrolled by the state, and the state, in turn, would be controlled by a ruling
elite of managers.

Burnham argued that managers would control the instruments of production in the-
ir own corporate favor, and the economy of state ownership would provide the ba-
sis for domination and exploitation by a ruling class of an extremity and absol-
uteness never before known. The masses would be curbed or constantly diverted so
that they would, as we say, go along with the managerial arrangements. In Burnh-
am's future state, history has come to an end because existence has removed its-
elf from historical process and become pure essence, its attributes those of of-
ficial meaning. Perfection is defined as the state of completeness in accordance
with the terms prescribed for it by the state, as a proposition in logic or a t-
heorem in mathematics might be faultless.

In We, Yevgeny Zamyatin envisaged a one-world state, but Burnham allowed for th-
ree. Three superstates would divide the world between them and would enter into
shifting alliances with one another. In 1941, Burnham thought the three would be
the United States, Europe, and Japan. The superpowers would wage war over margi-
nal territory. "Ostensibly," Burnham said, "these wars will be directed from ea-
ch base for the conquest of the other bases. But it does not seem possible for
any one of these to conquer the others; and even two of them in coalition could
not win a decisive and lasting victory over the third."

By 1974, several of Burnham's predictions has already proved false, a result of
his irrepressible tendency to assume that present conditions would persist unch-
anged indefinitely; but a more damning indictment of his vision is the hypocrisy
concealed behind the attack on power. Burnham was infatuated with the image of
totalitarianism; he was fascinated by the power he attacked and he despised the
democracy he should have defended. Ultimately, Burnham voiced the secret desire
of the English intelligentsia to destroy the old, egalitarian version of Social-
ism and usher in a new hierarchical society in which the intellectual could at
last get his hands on the whip.

                     Liberal View of Democratic Citizenship

The liberal view of democratic citizenship that developed in the 17th and 18th
centuries was fundamentally different from that of the classical Greeks. The pu-
rsuit of private interests with as little interference as possible from governm-
ent was seen as the road to human happiness and progress rather than the public
obligations and involvement in the collective community that were emphasized by
the Greeks. Freedom was to be realized by limiting the scope of governmental ac-
tivity and political obligation and not through immersion in the collective life
of the polis. The basic role of the citizen was to select governmental leaders
and keep the powers and scope of public authority in check. On the liberal view,
the rights of citizens against the state were the focus of special emphasis.

Over time, the liberal democratic notion of citizenship developed in two direct-
ions. First, there was a movement to increase the proportion of members of soci-
ety who were eligible to participate as citizens - especially through extending
the right of suffrage - and to ensure the basic policical equality of all. Seco-
nd, there was a broadening of the legitimate activities of government and a use
of governmental power to redress imbalances in social and economic life. Politi-
cal citizenship became an instrument through which groups and classes with suff-
icient numbers of votes could use the state power to enhance their social and e-
conomic well-being.

Within the general liberal view of democratic citizenship, tensions have develo-
ped over the degree to which government can and should be used as an instrument
for promoting happiness and well-being. Political philosopher Martin Diamond has
categorized two views of democracy as follows. On the one hand, there is the "l-
ibertarian" perspective that stresses the private pursuit of happiness and emph-
asizes the necessity for restraint on government and protection of individual l-
iberties. On the other hand, there is the "majoritarian" view that emphasizes t-
he "task of the government to uplift and aid the common man against the malefac-
tors of great wealth." The tensions between these two views are very evident to-
day. Taxpayer revolts and calls for smaller government and less government regu-
lation clash with demands for greater government involvement in the economic ma-
rketplace and the social sphere.

================================================================================

                            Open Government Statutes

Open government statutes in California have proved both beneficial and harmful.
In the energy commission, for example, as in other government commissions, near-
ly all decisions must be made in public session for which at least seven days'
notice must be given. (Two notable exceptions to public participation in commis-
sion meetings are meetings held to discuss pending litigation and meetings held
to discuss staff personnel matters.) The determination of which decisions can be
made by the executive director and which are strictly reserved for the commissi-
on becomes quite important in this context. If something is a matter for the co-
mmission, there must be a public hearing with attendant publicity and preparati-
on of materials for distribution at the meeting. (A formal delegation of author-
ity authorizes the executive director to make purchases of goods and services,
including consulting services, costing less than $ 5,000.)

Furthermore, no more than three of the commission's five commissioners may meet
informally with one another or with the executive director or any member of his
staff to discuss commission activities. Such behavior would be a violation of o-
pen government statutes. Staff briefings must take place commissioner by commis-
sioner or through a commissioner's advisers. More frequently, commissioners or
their advisers contact the staff for information, but all such requests must be
submitted in writing.

An example of the impact of open government on the operating procedures of a co-
mmission is the energy commission's budgetary process. The budget for the commi-
ssion, unlike that prepared in other state agencies, was prepared in public ses-
sion by the five commissioners. The session was not simply a "review and commen-
t" session, since the commissioners had not previously discussed the budget. Ev-
ery item proposed for the budget could be commented on by anyone who attended t-
he hearings. The budget was then forwarded to the governor's office prior to su-
bmission to the legislature as part of the excutive budget. In a recent case in-
volving development of regulations to ban use of gas pilot lights in new equipm-
ents sold in the state, much of the actual development of the regulations was p-
erformed by an advisory committee of both environmental and industry representa-
tives in public workshops.

Perhaps open government's effect has been greatest in the promulgation of rules
and regulations. Complaints have arisen from several legislators and the news m-
edia about the slowness of the energy commission in setting regulations. In fac-
t, the commission may be unable to meet the original legislatively mandated dea-
dlines for several sets of regulations, including standards for newly construct-
ed nonresidential buildings. If, however, a commission attempts to handle some
matters without input from state agencies and interested groups in open meeting-
s, it will be criticized for circumventing the open government intentions of the
legislation. Thus, if present practices continue, the commission will continue
to be criticezed for moving too slowly; but if it attempts to move more quickly,
the commissioners open themselves up to charges of attempting to circumvent the
letter and spirit of the open government law.

================================================================================

                             Social Welfare Cutback

It is commonly asserted that an ideology is powerless against policical interest
groups and against the unflagging tendency of established social institutions to
expand. To dispute this claim, however, we need only look to the present day po-
litical situation. There is, at the present time, unfortunate political revolut-
ion underway among Western countries that is occurring in spite of potent polit-
ical opposition.

For most of the postwar period, there was a proliferation of government social
welfare programs designed to raise the income share of the poor. Such programs
serve, in variiuos forms, to redistribute wealth among the population at large,
generally taking from those who are better situated and giving to those who are
economically disadvantaged. As a result of their implementation, the plight of
the poor was ameliorated to an even greater degree than was expected.

Despite these positive advances, one school of ideology, known as _redistributi-
onal retrenchment_, has long argued that the gains from redistribution programs
are far outweighed by adverse economic side-effects. In the wake of the worldwi-
de slowdown in economic growth following the first oil embargo of 1973, these a-
rguments have been treated with increasing respect, resulting in deliberate gov-
ernment curtailing of social welfare spending. As a consequence, in the United
States, England, Germany, and even in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, public i-
ncome transfer programs have been or are being cut back. On the face of it, only
France and Italy seem to be resisting the trend; Switzerland, though it partook
in the rapid expansion of the earlier period, has temporarily reached a plateau
in spending. The political mentality that supports redistributional retrenchment
now holds consierable sway. As a consequence of the deliberate government curta-
ilment of social welfare spending, the Western poor are measureably worse off t-
oday than they were just a decade ago.

In addition, every dollar cut from the budget of such programs reduces the gove-
rnment payroll by twenty cents. Thus, the curtailment of social welfare programs
has caused a decrease in the number of government jobs. The resulting unemploym-
ent has not been fully absorbed by the private sector. There is, then, in addit-
ion to the many poor whose benefits have been cut, a large number of middle-inc-
ome citizens who oppose redistributional retrenchment.

Given those facts, one would expect everyday political forces to reverse this t-
rend of social welfare cutbacks. Yet no reversal has occurred. Counting on fund-
amental principles of democracy and the ultimate power of the vote, political h-
opefuls have sought to attain office by appealing to such people and addressing
the genuine economic distress they are experiencing. Their efforts have, for the
most part, failed. Indeed, those government legislators, administrators, and ex-
ecutives who felt confident that they would succeed in abating the trend, simply
because the number of voting citizens who stood to suffer was so large, underes-
timated the power of the redistributional-retrenchment ideology. It continues to
advance notwithstanding the adverse effect it has had on huge sectors of the po-
pulation.

================================================================================

                       Montesquieu's Theory of Government

It is important to note the ways in which Montesquieu's classification of the f-
orms of government in _The Spirit of the Laws_ departed from the classical trad-
ition.

Montesquieu's first originality was to regard democracy and aristocracy (which
in Aristotle's classification are two separate types) as two modes of a form of
government called republican. For Montesquieu, the fundamental distinction is b-
etween the republic, including the two modes of aristocracy and democracy, and
the monarchy. According to Montesquieu, Aristotle was unaware of the true nature
of monarchy - which is understandable since monarchy, as Montesquieu conceived
it, had been achieved only in postclassical Europe.

These are an underlying reason for this departure. In Montesquieu, the distinct-
ion between forms of government is also a conscious distinction between social
organizations and structures. Aristotle had created a theory of forms of govern-
ment to which he had apparently assigned a general validity, but he was presupp-
osing the Greek city-state as its social basis. Monarchy, aristocracy, and demo-
cracy constituted the three modes of political organization of the Greek city-s-
tates. It was justifiable, in this context, to distinguish types of government
according to the number of persons holding the sovereign power. But this kind of
analysis really implied that these three forms of government were, in modern te-
ms, the political superstructure of a certain type of society.

In classical political philosophy, no one bothered to examine the relationship
between the types of political superstructure and the social foundations. No one
had clearly formulated the question of to what extent a classification of polit-
ical regimes can be made without considering the organization of societies. Mon-
tesquieu's decisive contribution was precisely to combine the analysis of forms
of government with the study of social organizations in such a way that each re-
gime is also seen as a certain type of society.

How did he establish this relationship between government and society? First Mo-
ntesquieu stated explicitly in Book VIII, Chapters 16, 17 and 19, that each of
these three forms of government corresponds to, or is consistent with, a certain
dimension of the society under consideration. Here is Montesquieu's most typical
pronouncement, from book VIII, Chapter 16: "It is natural for a republic to have
only a small territory; otherwise it cannot long subsist."

A little further on he says: "A monarchical state ought to be of moderate exten-
t." Finally, a third passage, from Chapter 19 of Book VIII: "A large empire sup-
poses a despotic authority in the person who governs."

If we wished to translate these formulas into strictly logical terms, we should
probably have to abandon a vocabulary of causality. We would be unable to say t-
hat once the territory of a state exceeds a certain size, despotism is inevitab-
le, but at least we could say that there is a natural correspondence between the
size of the society and the type of government. In any case, it is by means of
this theory of size that Montesquieu linked the classification of government to
what is now called social morphology, in Durkheinm's term.

================================================================================

                     Evolution of Federal Budgetary System

The basic character of our governmental and political institutions conditions t-
he federal budgetary system. The working relationships between branches, and be-
tween the elements within each branch, are intricate, subtle, and in continuous
change - affected by partisan politics, personalities, social forces, and public
opinion. A few landmark stages in the evolution of the present system provide p-
erspective.

In 1789 Alexander Hamilton, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, affirmed and
successfully established a position of strong executive leadership in matters of
public finance. His proposals on revenues, banking, and the assumption of prior
debts of both national and state governments were based on his philosophy that
federal fiscal policies should be designed to encourage economic growth. Howeve-
r, Hamilton's successors, and the Presidents under whom they served, did not fo-
llow his concept of executive responsibility for "plans of finance."

Partly through default, Congress took charge of all phases of fiscal policy. At
the outset, each chamber was so small that coherent initiative was possible. (T-
he first House had some 60 members - about the number of its present Appropriat-
ions Committee.) Spending estimates, considered in Committee of the Whole in 17-
89, were later referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. In 1865 expenditures
were assigned to a new Appropriations Committee while revenues remained with the
Ways and Means Committee. In 1885 most spending proposals were subdivided among
the legislative committees so that appropriation bills came to be handled by nu-
merous committees (14 in the House and 15 in the Senate), each dealing directly
with the departments. The presidential role was minimal.

By the turn of the century there wasa clear need for reform in financial manage-
ment. At all levels of government, officials spent money on activities "as auth-
orized by law" and in line with "appropriations" made by legislative bodies - u-
sually after committee consideration. Other officials collected taxes and fees
under various unrelated statutes. Such a system - or lack-of-system - worked wi-
thin reason as long as governments had little to do. But as government activiti-
es grew, becoming more technical and closely interrelated, this lack-of-system
bogged down.

Several factors played a part in the eventual breakthrough. In the first decade
of the twentieth century, an "executive budget" came into successful use by some
cities and states. President Taft's Commission on Efficiency and Economy prepar-
ed an illustrative federal budget which - while rejected by congress. - command-
ed broad public support. The more advanced methods developed by European govern-
ment came to American attertion. World War I precipitated accounting chaos, with
an aftermath of scandal. The need for new and better methods was established be-
yond dispute.

The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 placed direct responsibility for preparat-
ion and execution of the federal budget upon the President, making a unified fe-
deral budget possible for the first time. The Act set up two new organizational
units, the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Bureau of the Budget. GAO is
headed by the Comptroller General, appointed by the President with Senate appro-
val for a 15-year term, and is regarded as primarily a congressional rather than
an executive resource. The Bureau, under a Director appointed by the President
_without_ Senate confirmation and serving at his pleasure, has from its incepti-
on been the President's chief reliance in budgetary and related matters.

================================================================================

                           Presidential Appointments

The main bureau of assuring that the resources of the federal government are we-
ll managed falls on relatively few of the five million men and women whom it em-
ploys. Under the department and agency heads there are 8,600 political, career,
military, and foreign service executives - the top managers and professionals -
who exert major influence on the manner in which the rest are directed and util-
ized. Below their level there are other thousands with assignments of some mana-
gerial significance, but we believe that the line of demarcation selected is the
best available for our purposes in this attainment.

In Addition to Presidential appointees in responsible posts, the 8,600 include
the three highest grades under the Classification Act; the three highest grades
in the postal field service; comparable grades in the foreign service; general
officers in the military service; and similar classes in other special services
and in agencies or positions excepted from the Classification Act.

There is no complete inventory of positions or people in federal service at this
level. The lack may be explained by separate agency statutes and personnel syst-
ems, diffusionamong so many special services, and absence of any central point (
short of the President himself) with jurisdiction over all upper-level personnel
of the government.

This Committee considers establishment and maintenance of a central inventory of
these key people and positions to be an elementary necessity, a first step in i-
mproved management throughout the Executive Branch.

Top Presidential appointees, about 500 of them, bear the brunt of translating t-
he hpilosophy and aims of the current administration into practical programs. T-
his group includes the secretaries and assistant secretaries of cabinet departm-
ents, agency heads and their deputies, heads and members of boards and commissi-
ons with fixed terms, and chiefs and directors of major bureaus, divisions, and
services. Appointments to many of these politically sensitive positions are made
on recommendation by department or agency heads, but all presumably reponsible
to Presidential leadership.

One qualification for office at this level is that there be no basic disagreeme-
nt with Presidential political philosophy, at least so far as administrative ju-
dgments and actions are concerned. Apart from the bi-partisan boards and commis-
sions, these men are normally identified with the political party of the Presid-
ent, or are sympathetic to it, although there are exceptions.

There are four distinguishable kinds of top Presidential appointees, including:

- Those whom the President selects at the outset to establish immediate and eff-
ective control over the government (e.g., Cabinet secretaries, agency heads, his
own White House staff and Executive Office Personnel).

- Those selected by department and agency heads in order to establish control w-
ithin their respective organizations (e.g. - assistant secretaries, deputies, a-
ssistants to, and major line posts in some bureaus and divisions).

- High-level appointees who - though often requiring clearance through political
or interest group channels, or both - must have known scientific or technical c-
ompetence (e.g. - the Surgeon General, the Commissioner of Education).

                   Government Patronage for Science and Arts

One of the most rapidly expanding sectors in American life since World War II h-
as been the government. Local, state, and national government expenditures for
goods and services rose from 13% of the gross national product in 1950 to 23% in
1970, reflecting a sixfold absolute increase in government spending. The expans-
ion was not limited to traditional domains, such as defense and welfare. New ta-
rget areas of government spending include the physical sciences, social science-
s, and the arts. Federal outlays for research in the physical sciences rose from
$ 0.6 billion in fiscal 1956 to $ 2.9 billion in 1963 and $ 3.8 billion in 1973.
Federal support of social science research, which stood at $ 30 million in 1956,
reached $ 412 million in 1973 (National Science Foundation, 1970: 243; 1974a: 1-
49). Expenditures by the National Endowment for the Arts (1973: 111-112) eviden-
ced a similar trend: initially appropriated $ 3 million during its first year of
operation in 1966, the National Endowment's budget reached $ 15 million in 1971
and $ 61 million by 1974.

The institutions engaged in artistic or scientific activity are centrally conce-
rned with the maintenance and extension of cultural systems (Parsons, 1961; Pet-
erson, 1976). The growth of government patronage for these areas suggests that
the facilitation and production of culture has become a major state activity in
the United States. The objectives underlying this state intervention are not we-
ll understood. The central purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relative st-
rengths of several alternative explanations for the government's involvement in
the production of culture. A second purpose is to suggest the likely impact of
government patronage on the physical sciences, social sciences, and arts in Ame-
rica.

Fore distinct models for explaining the state's growing interest in the product-
ion of culture can be identified. One model emphasizes the value of patronage f-
or the maintenance of the cultural institutions in question. A second model str-
esses the utility of the investment for capital accumulation. A third model poi-
nts toward the value of supporting science and art for the administration of go-
vernment programs. The fourth model identifies the ideological potential of sci-
ence and art as a primary reason for government patronage.

Science and art for their own sake. The first model of government patronage is
predicated on the structural-functionalist assumption that the government is a
relatively neutral instrument for the articulation and pursuit of collective go-
als in a society with relatively autonomous subsystems (Parsons, 1969). Pure sc-
ience and art are vital societal subsystems, and the government moves to protect
and develop these areas to ensure the continued production of culture for the b-
enefit of all members of society. Thus, the government intervenes directly as t-
he final patron of public goods that would otherwise be unavailable. Increasing-
ly, the paradigms (Kuhn, 1970: 175) in science and art dictate expenditures that
increasingly outstrip the resources of the institutions themselves. Equipment,
staff, and data-processing costs of physical science research far exceed the co-
mmercial potential of most scientific projects; the cost of conducting systemat-
ic and reliable social scientific investigations can no longer be met through p-
roduct marketing or private foundations; what is more, artistic organizations a-
re increasingly incapable of underwriting all production costs through income a-
nd contributions. Under these conditions, government patronage is introduced to
ensure the flow of cultural goods to society.

Two important corollaries follow from this formulation, which make it empirical-
ly testable. First, the timing of government intervention should primarily be r-
elated to economic crises faced by the arts and science themselves, not to cris-
es in the political system, economy, or elsewhere. Second, government intervent-
ion should genreally take the form of protecting the paradigm of the arts and s-
ciences. Specifically, federal funding should be allocated to the most creative
artists and organizations, as defined by the relevant artistic community. Simil-
arly, funding should be preferentially bestowed on scientists whose research is
making the greatest contribution to the advance of the scientific discipline, r-
egardless of its relevance for outside problems or crises.

                                Political Shows

Seventy-five years after the death of Louis XIV, the French Revolution enlarged
considerably the dimensions of the government show, organizing mass demonstrati-
ons with grandiose staging. The national holiday on July 14, 1790, attracted 20-
0,000 people to the Champs de Mars. Robespierre held the main role as president
of the Convention. While choirs intoned a specially composed hymn entitled "Fat-
her of the Universe, Supreme Intelligence," he lighted the flame before a statue
of Atheism. Then, marching at the head of the column of members of the Conventi-
on, with each member carrying a bouquet of flowers and ears of wheat, he procee-
ded from the Toilers Gardens to the Champs de Mars, where a symbolic hillock to-
pped with Tree of Freedom had been erected.

The objective of these vast liturgical assemblies? To strike the public imagina-
tion, mobilize it, and involve it in a collective ritual. Later, mass demonstra-
tions in Red Square or Tiananmen Square would be held for the same reason. Part-
icipation in such rituals has become an act of allegiance to official beliefs.
Other regimes, like fascism or Nazism, aim at not only raising the consciousness
of the people, but at creating a "mass psychology" by using gigantic demonstrat-
ors, whether in Rome or in the stadium at Nuremberg. Here, following Durkheims
theory, the demonstration has the double aspect of ceremony-spectacle and diver-
sion. It is diversion also in the sense of diverting attention away from the tr-
ue problems and realities. The public lives in a surrealistic atmosphere of fes-
tivals and games, like plebeians during the Roman empire.

Other political systems also mis show business and politics in a minor way. Ame-
rican elections are the occasion for confetti, parades, and majorettes, and each
national political convention has a show business style orchestra. For that mat-
ter, political rallies are often held in places generally reserved for sports e-
vents like Madison Square Garden in New York, where the Democratic Convention w-
as held, or the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, where the first Ford-Car-
ter debate was held. And, as with a show, we speak of the "public" to designate
the people. Some refer to what they consider to be the public's taste for theat-
ricalizaion, arguing that politics must use star system techniques to save it f-
rom the public's lack of interest, to adapt it to "mass culture". From the mome-
nt when the television viewer can choose between his president, a film, and a v-
ariety show, the president has to become an entertainer to compete effectively
with show business professionals and keep his popularity rating. In short, to c-
ompete with stars, political stars have to use their mehtods and personalize th-
eir "performances".

                              Forms of Government

More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle utilized two major criteria in clas-
sifying governments. One was the _unmber of persons_ in which governing authori-
ty vested; the other, the _primary purpose_ toward which the exercise of govern-
mental powers is directed.

In terms of the first criterion Aristotle distinguished three forms of governme-
nt, viz., government by the one, by the few, and by the many. The second basis
of classification, i.e., purpose, led him to differentiate "true" from "pervert-
ed" forms. True forms of government are characterized by the exercise of govern-
mental authority for the benefit of all members of the body politic, whereas pe-
rverted types are featured by the use of governing power to promote the special
and selfish interests of the ruling personnel. Government by the one for the be-
nefit of all is kingship or royalty; government by the one for his private adva-
ntage is tyranny. Government by the few, if conducted for the purpose of promot-
ing the common welfare, constitutes aristocracy. If the few rule in furtherance
of their own selfish interests, the government is an oligarchy. The dominant few
are likely to be men of property interested in increasing their wealth. Finally,
government by the many (the citizens at large) for the benefit of all was ident-
ified as polity or constitutional government, whereas government by the many, u-
sually the poor or the needy, for the purpose of promoting their selfish intere-
sts, was named democracy, a perverted form of government.

Unlike Aristotle, contemporary political scientists usually classify forms of g-
overnment without introducing a test of purpose or motivation with respect to t-
he use of governmental powers. Definitions of democracy, for instance, seldom i-
nclude stipulations concerning the objectives to be attained by a government of
the democratic type. However, an underlying assumption, even though unstated, s-
eems to be that democratic processes of government probably will result in prom-
otion of the common welfare.

Aristotle conceived of government by the many, whether of the true or perverted
variety, as involving direct action by the body of qualified citizens in the fo-
rmulation and adoption of policies. Hamilton and Madison, in their comments abo-
ut democracy in the Federalist Papers, revealed a like conception of the nature
of democracy. Thus Madison distinguished between a republic (representative gov-
ernment) and pure democracy. In his words a pure democracy is "a society consis-
ting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government
in person." A distinction is still drawn between direct and indirect democracy,
but emphasis now is placed on the latter form, that is, democracy of the repres-
entative variety. Although direct democracy survives in a few small communities,
e.g., New England towns and some of the cantons of Switzerland, representative
democracy prevails in communities of large size. Conequently, the term democrac-
y as used today almost always signifies a democratic government of the indirect
or representative type.

                             A Supreme Court Ruling

Mary Hamilton, a twenty-eight-year-old black field secretary for the Congress of
Racial Equality (CORE), participated in a demonstration in Gadsden, Alabama, in
1963. White police officers arrested her, along with fellow demonstrators. Beli-
eving their arrests to be unlawful, the group petitioned the Circuit Court of E-
towah Country for release on a wit of habeas corpus (unlawful imprisonment). The
hearing on the petition was held on June 25, before Judge Cunningham, a white j-
udge, assisted by white court clerks and bailiffs.

Black attorneys Charles Conley and Norman Amaker represented the petitioners and
white Solicitor Rayburn spoke for the state. Mr. Rayburn followed the southern
establishment practice of addressing each black witness by his or her first nam-
e, despite objections from the opposing counsel.

When Mary Hamilton completed her direct testimony, Solicitor Rayburn began his
cross-examination by asking, "What is your name, please?"

"Miss Mary Hamilton."

"Mary - who were you arrested by?"

"My name is Miss Hamilton. Please address me correctly," she said.

"Who were you arrested by, Mary?" the solicitor asked again, deliberately.

"I will not answer a question -" she began, and Attorney Amaker interjected, "t-
he witness's name is Miss Hamilton."

"- your question until I am addressed correctly," she finished.

"Answer the question," Judge Cunningham" ordered.

Miss Hamilton would not be intimidated. "I will not answer them unless I am add-
ressed correctly."

"You are in contempt of court," ruled the judge.

"Your Honor - your Honor -" Attorney Conley began, but the judge paid no attent-
ion.

"You are in contempt of this court," he went on, "and you are sentenced to five
days in jail and a fifty-dollar fine."

Miss Hamilton was taken to jail then and there, and served the five days. Since
she did not intend to pay the fine, and therefore would be subject to another t-
wenty days in jail, she was allowed out on bond to appeal the contempt convicti-
on.

On July 25, sht petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court to review the contempt cit-
ation on two grounds. Her lawyers contended that the solicitor's manner of addr-
essing black witness violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Ame-
ndment. Finding no cases on this point, they relied on logic, history, and etiq-
uette. They rejected the state's reliance on Emily Post and Amy Vanderbilt beca-
use their books did not discuss the use of first names in a racial situation. T-
hey also reminded the court that Miss Hamilton's contempt conviction violated t-
he due process clause because she was summarily sentenced without even being gi-
ven a trial - an opportunity to present a defense to the charge. (Remember the
Red Queen in _Alice in Wonderland_ - "sentence first, trial afterward"?) The Al-
abama Supreme Court found, however, that "the question was a lawful one and the
witness invoked no valid legal exemption to support her refusal to answer it."

The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund then took the case up to the United
States Supreme Court for review. The defense lawyers relied on long-standing pr-
inciples governing the conduct of prosecuting attorneys: as quasi-judicial offi-
cers of the court they are under a duty not to prejudice a party's case through
overzealous prosecution or to detract from the impartiality of courtroom atmosp-
here. The defense presented historical and sociological proof that the forms of
addres used by Solicitor Rayburn were a distinct part of a "racial caste system"
that deprived black citizens of equal protection of the laws. They also quoted
from novels by Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Lillian Smith. The United Sta-
tes Supreme Court handed down a summary decision the same day. Six justices joi-
ned in an order reversing Miss Hamiliton's contempt citation.

                               Community Property

Community property is a legal concept that is growing in popularity in the Unit-
ed States. A few years ago only the western states had community property laws
and few people east of the Mississippi had ever heard the expression "community
property." Now several states have adopted or modified laws regarding community
property.

Community property is jointly owned by both wife and husband. Generally, the pr-
operty that was owned by a spouse before the marriage is known as separate or s-
pecific property. It remains the property of the original possessor in case of
a separation or divorce. Community property is anything gained by the joint eff-
ort of the spouses.

Gifts specifically bestowed upon only one party, or legacies to only one spouse,
are separate property. However, courts often determine that a donor had the int-
ention to give the gift to both parties, even though his words or papers may ha-
ve indicated otherwise. Community property goes to the surviving partner in case
of the death of one spouse. Only that half of the property owned by the testator
can be willed away.

================================================================================

                                      Jury

A fundamental element of the American criminal justice system is trial by an im-
partial jury. This constitutionally protected guarantee is made meaningful by a-
llowing the defendant to challenge and have removed from the panel those prospe-
ctive jurors who are demonstrably prejudiced in the case. Such prejudice may be
based on a juror's having some tangible interest in the case or on his relation-
ship to the participants. Beyond this, a juror may be challenged if the defenda-
nt can show that the juror has preconceptions about the issues or parties that
would prevent him from rendering a verdict based solely on the law and the evid-
ence put forth at trial. In order to enable the defendant to discover these dis-
qualifying factors, prospective jurors are subjected to questioning by the court
or counsel or both. This interrogation is known as the _voir dire_ examination.
Generally, the courts have recognized that any prejudice affecting the ability
of a juror to decide a case fairly is a sufficient ground for a challenge. Such
prejudices can be categorized in two basic ways: as a bias implied as a matter
of law and as actual bias. The former may include such objective factors as a j-
uror's relationship to a participant in the trial, whereas the latter may invol-
ve such subjective characteristics as racial, religious, economic, social, or p-
olitical prejudices that would prevent the juror from trying the case fairly.

There is, however, a fundamental disagreement as to the extent to which the _vo-
ir dire_ examination does, in fact, uncover juror prejudice. It has been sugges-
ted that once the prospective jurors are in the courtroom, they feel that disqu-
alification for bias would impugn their integrity, and may, therefore, be willi-
ng to lie to avoid removal from the panel.

While it may be true that people will not invariably answer truthfully on _voir
dire_, the same may be said of other stages of the trial. That witnesses do not
always testify truthfully at trial compels neither the conclusion that it is us-
eless to examine or cross-examine them nor the conclusion that the trial process
itself is invalid. Similarly, the recognition that prospective jurors may at ti-
mes suppress what they know to be their own weaknesses need not lead to the det-
ermination that the _voir dire_ process itself is worthless. There is, for the
most part, an absence of bothexplicit statutory guidelines and clear Supreme Co-
urt rulings indicating what specific inquires must be made if _voir dire_ is to
fulfill its constitutional function. What the Constitution requires, and will be
held to require, of juror interrogation as to, for example, racial prejudice is
unclear. Recent case law suggests, however, that policy considerations and perh-
aps the Constitution itself, call for some degree of direct and specific questi-
oning as to not only racial bias, but also as to other common sources of prejud-
ice as well.

================================================================================

                              Use of Deadly Force

From the fifteenth century to the present, the justification for usting deadly
force in the aprehension of suspected criminals has been based largely on the l-
egal distinction between a felony and a misdemeanor. Law enforcement officers m-
ay use deadly force to prevetn the escape of fleeing felons, but they may not u-
se it to apprehend fleeing misdemeanants.

The rationale for permitting deadly force to be used against felons, at least in
early common law and in eighteenth-century America, was that all felonies - mud-
er, rape, robbery, burglary, arson, and a few other serious crimes - were punis-
hable by death. Hence, it made little difference if suspected felons were killed
while they were being apprehended because, in the eyes of the law, they had alr-
eady forfeited their lives by committing serious crimes. Deadly force was seen
serely as a means of expediting the judicial process.

Today, this rationale no longer obtains. Most states recognize various classes
of felonies (Class A, Class B, and so on), ranging from the most serious to the
least serious, and not all of these felonies are punishable by death. In fact,
some are punishable by as little as a year and a day in prison. Neither do all
offenses now classified as felonies involve the use or threat of physical force
or violence. Fraud and embezzlement, for instance, are nonviolient felonies; so
are tax evasion and a number of other so-called "white-collar" crimes. Since the
primary distinction between a felony and a misdemeanor in current federal law is
a technical one (the length of the sentence imposed upon conviction) and since
some misdemeanors are more dangerous than some felonies, it is unreasonable to
base the justification for the use of deadly force on the apprehension of suspe-
cted offenders on this distinction alone.

Las enforcement officers in pursuit of fleeing suspects are called upon to make
difficult on-the-spot judgments. The facts available to them are often vague, i-
ncomplete, and ambiguous, yet their decisions must be both swift and sound. They
should not be based on a legal distinction that fails to discriminate among fel-
onies of varying degrees of danger and seriousness. Rather, they should be based
on the nature of the felony and the circumstances surrounding the flight. If the
felony is a violent one and the circumstances are life threatening - that is, if
the fleeing suspect uses or threatens to use deadly force to avoid apprehension
- then the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer may be justifiable.
However, other, less drastic measures should always be considered first.

================================================================================

                             Privacy Protection Act

The Privacy Protection Act was the response of Congress to the 1978 Supreme Cou-
rt decision in _Zurcher Vs. Stanford Daily_. _Zurcher_ involved the issuing of a
search warrant against the premises of an innocent party, the student newspaper
of Stanford University, in an attempt to seize photographs of a demonstration t-
hat had occurred earlier at a local hospital. Several police officers had been
injured by the demonstrators, and it was believed that the Standford _Daily_ po-
ssessed photographs that could assist in identifying the officer's assailants.

When the Stanford _Daily_ sued the officers who searched their premises for the-
se photographs, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Constitution does not bar
the use of a search warrant for premises occupied by a person who is not a susp-
ect in a crime. As long as probable cause exists to believe that evidence is lo-
cated in the place to be searched, a search warrant may properly be issued.

The opinion was quickly criticized by many segments of the press. Some even cal-
led it the opening wedge in the creation of a totalitarian state. Within days,
legislation was introduced to limit warrant-authorized searches of the premises
of those engaged in activities proteceted by freedom of the press. And in 1980
Congress passed the Privacy Protection Act.

Stated briefly, the act makeds it unlawful for officers investigating a crime to
search for or seize "work product" or "documentary materials" possessed by a pe-
rson in connection with or for the purpose of disseminating a public communicat-
ion, such as a newspaper, magazine, or book publication, or a television or rad-
io broadcast.

"Work product" is defined as any material created in anticipation of public com-
munication, including notes, that contains the mental impressions, conclusions,
opinions, or theories of the person who created it. To qualify as work product,
the material need not have been prepared by the person in possession of the mat-
erial. Thus, a report revealing government corruption made by a "whistle blower"
working for a federal agency and mailed to a newspaper for possible publication
would constitute work product.

"Documentary materials" are defined as any materials upon which information is
recorded that are held by a person in connection with making a public communica-
tion. They include printed materials, photographs, films, video and audio tapes,
and electronically recorded tapes or discs. Documentary materials may have been
routinely prepared by others with no intent to publish and thus may contain no
impressions, opinions, or theories of the person who intends to make them publi-
c.

Although the distinction between work product and documentary materials may som-
etimes be unclear, it is important, because the act affords a higher level of p-
rotection to work product than to documentary materials. It outlines certain ex-
ceptional circumstances in which authorities may legally search for either work
product or documentary materials, and the range of these circumstances is great-
er in the case of documentary materials.

================================================================================

                The Impeachment Clause in American Constitution

Clearly, the framers of the Constitution did not intend to adopt wholesale the
British practice regarding impeachment, for they deliberately rejected several
aspects of that practice. Thus, the proper source of law to use to detemine what
the framers meant by "high crimes and misdemeanors" as the basic ground for imp-
eachment is uncertain.

Extremely significant is the fact that the British Parliament could and did, at
its discretion, impose a criminal penalty in the course of impeachment. Hence,
we cannot intelligently claim that American impeachment can go beyond criminal
offenses on the basis of the fact that the antecedent British practice did so.
Granted the power of Parliament to impose a criminal penalty, any British impea-
chment could be potentially "criminal." Thus, there was no occasion for the Bri-
tish to speculate about whether impeachment could be based on noncriminal charg-
es, which is the insistent American question.

At the same time, the American concept of impeachment, even on a criminal basis,
may not encompass all crimes. The draft impeachment clause considered by the fr-
amers at one point specified crimes "against the United States" as due cause for
impeachment. The deletion of that phrase, as a matter of style, does not change
the apparent intent that only public-oriented offenses be impeachable.

Even assuming that the framers intended to define the phrase "high crimes and m-
isdemeanors" with reference to British impeachment practice, what that practice
was is very unclear. Blackstone asserted that impeachment reached only crimes.
On the other hand, it appears that until after 1695, the British in fact impeac-
hed certain officers for high crimes and misdemeanors, sometimes attaching crim-
inal penalties, when their conduct did not violate the ordinary criminal law.

However, British practice since 1715 seems to have limited the grounds for impe-
achment to conventional crimes. That apparent narrowing of the basis for impeac-
hment is not unusual in the light of the major purpose that impeachment served
in England. Initially, that purpose was to establish the doctrine of ministerial
responsibility to the Parliamentary in executing the law, the king himself being
above the law. By 1721, however, with parliamentary supremacy over the crown re-
latively firmly established, impeachment was a dying institution. Whereas fifty
impeachment trials were held in Great Britain between 1620 and 1775, only four
have been held since that date.

Thus, it appears that the British did not have a uniform, consistent definition
of "high crimes and misdemeanors" in cases of impeachment. Rather, that concept
changed as parliamentary government replaced royal government. Because it is so
uncertain whether the framers intended to adopt the British definition of "high
crimes and misdemeanors" and exactly what the British definition was at any giv-
en time, the purpose of impeachment as expressed by delegates to the Constituti-
onal Convention, the terms they rejected as a basis for impeachment, and the te-
xt of the Constitution itself are the most reliable guidelines to use in determ-
ining what the framers meant by "high crimes and misdemeanors."

================================================================================

              Judicial Determination of Employment Discrimination

Civil rights law has two markedly different legal standards for determining when
illegal discrimination has occurred: the "intent" and the "effects" standards.
In intent cases, the courts have developed a variety of way to determine whether
intentional discrimination exists, since few decision makers publicize their di-
scriminatory intent. Primary among these is numerical evidence of unequal resul-
ts, because "in many cases the only available avenue of proof is the use of sta-
tistics to uncover clandestine and covert discrimination" (International Board
of Teamsters v. United States, 1977).

In effects cases, however, numerical evidence is not used to assess the likelih-
ood that the accused discriminator has intentionally caused harm to the victim
on the basis of race, national origin, or sex, because the intent of the discri-
minator is not determinative. In these cases, numerical evidence serves to expo-
se the existing unequal conditions in our society, whether they are caused by o-
ne discriminator or many, intentionally or not.

Perhaps the single most important decision in the evolution of equal employment
opportunity law, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., best explains this significant diffe-
rence between an intent and an effects standard. In Griggs, the Supreme Court i-
nterpretation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act invalidated general int-
elligence tests and other criteria for employment that disproportionately exclu-
ded minorities, on the ground that these selection devices were not shown to be
dictated by "business necessity." Although the lower courts had found that Duke
Power's tests were not deliberately discriminatory, the Supreme Court concluded:
"Good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment pro-
cedures or testing mechanisms that operate as 'built-in headwinds' for minority
groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability." All employment selection
mechanisms that have a "disparate effect" - that screen out a percentage of min-
orities or women disproportionate to that of whites or males when compared to t-
heir presence in the relevant labor market - are not unlawful. Griggs establish-
es, however, that the employer must demonstrate that practices with an adverse
impact on the opportunities of minorities and women do, in fact, fairly measure
or predict actual performance on the job.

Numerical evidence of unequal results, then, is not conclusive proof that illeg-
al discrimination has been committed. Under the effects tests, the actions that
produced such results may be lawful if the challenged decision maker can show t-
hat there was no reasonable alternative other than to perpetuate the unequal re-
sults. Nor is evidence of unequal results likely to be scrutinized by federal e-
nforcement agencies if the outcome of the total selection procedure - its "bott-
om-line" statistical profil - is acceptable, even though individual components
of that selection procedure may be illegal.

================================================================================

                                 Legal Services

Planners of legal services programs need to be keenly aware of the social and e-
conomic problems of the community, the geographical areas and the population gr-
oups most in need of services, and local political factors that will affect the
operation of the program. If a legal services program is to be effective, decis-
ions concerning its operation should not be subject to the pulls of competing i-
nterests. Safeguards against undue influence of political or other community po-
wer groups, therefore, should be built into the program structure.

Some of the early demonstration projects of the 1960s received excellent support
from political leaders. In other cases, political opposition seriously interfer-
ed with the operation of the programs. In one community, a committee on poverty
appointed by the mayor launched a full-scale attack on the community action pro-
gram that was the parent organization of the legal services unit. Subversion and
misuse of funds were alleged. Even though the attack was not directed against t-
he legal services unit itself, the atmosphere of tension and the curtailment of
funds to the parent organization that resulted were felt by some staff members
of the unit to have handicapped its programs. The community action program had
helped give birth to various organizations of local residents, such as tenants'
councils, which, in turn, were sources of cases in controversial areas. After t-
he attack on the program, there was a drop in the number of requests for legal
defense of tenants who withheld rent payments as a means of forcing slum landlo-
rds to repair property that did not meet standards set by the city building cod-
es. Such defense is authorized by the state's real property law, but fear of po-
litical retaliation appeared to engender hesitation on the part of both the com-
munity action program staff and the local tenants' groups to press this importa-
nt, precedent-setting issue.

In some communinties, top positions in legal assistance programs have tradition-
ally been political appointees. This policy can create problems of two kinds. F-
irst, if the political administration of the community is unfriendly toward the
idea of new legal services programs, the work of the program can be substantial-
ly nullified if the unit is headed by a political appointee. Second, quality st-
affing in any agency may be hard to achieve if the criteria for choice are poli-
tical. This problem can be a particular hazard to legal services programs that
operate through existing agencies, since it is often difficult to break old, es-
tablished political patterns. On the other hand, the public endorsement of top
political leaders in the community can greatly enhance the legal unit's chance
of gaining community acceptance.

                               Judges and Juries

A recent study surveyed 3,576 trials in two reporting samples. Over 500 judges
cooperated in the study. The survey was conducted using judges as reporters for
jury trials. Two major questions were explored in the survey, "First, what is t-
he magnitude and direction of the disagreement between judge and jury? And, sec-
ond, what are the sources and explanations of such disagreement?"

The study found that judges and juries agree (would decide the same case the sa-
me way) in 75.4 percent of the cases. If cases in which the jury hung are elimi-
nated, the overall agreement rate rises to 78 percent. Thus at the outset, what-
ever the defects of the jury system, it can be seen that the jury at least arri-
ves at the same result as the judge in over three-fourths of the cases.

The direction of disagreement is clearly toward a more lenient jury than judge.
The trend was not isolated to any particular type of offense but was spread thr-
oughout crime categories. Additionally, the pattern found was that in convictio-
ns, juries tended to be more lenient as far as counts, degrees, and sentencing.

For civil cases the percentage of agreement and disagreement was about the same
except that there did not appear to be any strong sentiment in favor of plainti-
ff over defendant (or vice versa) by the jury.

In cases decided differently because the judge had facts the jury did not, gene-
rally, these facts related to suppressed evidence, personal knowledge of the de-
fendant's prior record, etc. The factors that made the difference between judge
and jury in these cases, then, were all facts that we as a society purposefully
keep from juries because the information is irrelevant or because it is highly
prejudicial. From the study it can be assumed that the judge, hearing the infor-
mation, did not disregard it but, quite the contrary, used it in reaching his
(harsher) judgment.

The overwhelming number of cases in which judge and jury agree argue for the ju-
ry's understanding of the evidence because it is not to be expected that a jury
deciding cases it does not understand and a judge deciding cases he does unders-
tand (we presume) would not agree in their results so often. Also, judges thems-
elves generally did not identify "jury misunderstood the facts" as the reason f-
or disagreement.

The level of sympathy that the jury had with the defendant did make some differ-
ence. Although generally the jury was neutral, in about 36 percent of the cases
the jury had some reaction (positive or negative) because of the personal chara-
cteristics, occupation, family, or court appearance. These factors affected jur-
ies differently depending on the age, race, or sex of the defendant. Through va-
rious statistical evaluations the study is able to state that "the sympathetic
defendant causes disagreement in ... 4 percent of all cases." Similar figures a-
pply for the unsympathetic defendant.

                             A Jury's Prejudgement

The right to an unbiased jury is an inseparable part of the right to trial by j-
ury as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. T-
his right guarantees that twelve impartial jurors will hear and "truly try" the
cause before them.

In September 1982, the California Supreme Court upheld a lower court's $ 9.2 mi-
llion verdict against Ford Motor Company despite the fact that three jurors had
been working crossword puzzles and one juror had been reading a novel during the
presentation of testimony. Four of the twelve jurors hearing the case were admi-
ttedly participating in the activities charged and were clearly guilty of misco-
nduct, yet the California Supreme Court found no resultant prejudice agaginst F-
ord's position.

In the United States, citizens are called upon by the government to serve as ju-
rors. Only under extraordinary circumstances may a citizen be excused froom such
service. Juries are therefore not necessarily composed of willing volunteers, b-
ut instead, are sometimes made up of individuals who are serving against their
will, and justice is adversely affected when citizens are "forced" to serve on
juries. In "Reflections of a Juror," the author, who served as a juror himself,
recognized two distinct perspectives shared among jurors. Some jurors have a ve-
ry positive attitude about their being asked to serve on a jury. Their perspect-
ive is that of rendering a public service by fulfilling their jury duties. On t-
he other hand, some jurors view their obligation as just that, a burdensome obl-
igation, and nothing more. Their attitude is one of getting through with the or-
deal as soon as possible, a let's-get-out-of-here-by-this-afternoon approach.

A study conducted with mock juries, concerned specifically with the issue of ju-
ror prejudgment, revealed that 25 percent of the jurors polled reached their de-
cision early in the trial. The jurors in the study who admitted to having made
up their minds before having heard all the evidence also stated that they gener-
ally held to their first impression assessments. By prejudging the outcome of t-
he case the jurors had, in effect, breached their sworn duty.

From a reading of the California Supreme Court's opinion, it appears that the C-
ourt itself had committed the one form of conduct universally prohibited, that
of prejudgment. Ford's battle was lost before it had even begun to present its
case. In the first place, Ford is a multibillion-dollar international corporati-
on with "pockets" deeper than most. Secondly, Ford had experienced a great deal
of negagive publicity resulting from recent jury verdicts awarding large sums of
money to victims of Pinto automobile accidents wherein it was determined that F-
ord had defectively designed the Pinto's gasoline tank so that it was prone to
explode upon rear end impacts. Finally, the plaintiff was a nineteen-year-old c-
ollege freshman whose pursuit of a medical career was abruptly ended when he su-
ffered extensive brain damage after the brakes on his 1966 Lincoln failed, caus-
ing him to crash into a fountain after careening down a steeply curving hillside
street. Ford presented a considerable amount of evidence in a attempt to prove
that the cause of the accident was driver error and faulty maintenance and not
defective design. The Supreme Court responded to Ford's arguments by stating th-
at the jury was responsible for judging the credibility of witnesses and it wou-
ld be wholly improper for the Court to usurp that function by reweighing the ev-
idence. How ironic that the Court should so gallantly refuse to upset the decis-
ion of the jury, a jury wherein four members admittedly were engaging in extran-
eous activities when they were supposed to be "judging the credibility of witne-
sses." It would appear from the misconduct of the jury and the conclusionary st-
atements of the California Supreme Court that Ford's liability was indeed a pre-
determined, prejudged fact.

If the decision has any impact upon our present system of justice, it will regr-
etfully be a negative one. The California Supreme Court had, in effect, approved
a standard of jury conduct so unconscionable as to, in the words of dissenting
Justice Richardson, "countenance such a complete erosion of a constitutional co-
mmand," namely, the right to a fair and impartial jury trial.

                       A Defendant's Self-Representation

The Sixth Amendment's right to the "assistance of counsel" has been the subject
of considerable litigation in twentieth-century American courts. The emphasis h-
as traditionally centered on the degree to which a criminal defendant can demand
the assistance of counsel in various courts and at different hierarchical stages
of the criminal proceeding. Although past courts have alluded to the idea that a
defendant has a converse right to proceed without counsel, the issue had not be-
en squarely addressed by the United States Supreme Court until late in its 1974-
75 term. At that time, the Court held that within the Sixth Amendment rests an
implied right of self-representation.

As early as 1964, Justice Hugo Black wrote that "the Sixth Amendment withholds
from federal courts, in all criminal proceedings, the power and authority to de-
prive an accused of his life or liberty unless he has or waives the assistance
of counsel". However, recognizing that the Sixth Amendment does not require rep-
resentation by counsel, it is quite another thing to say that the defendant has
a constitutional right to reject professional assistance and proceed on his own.
Notwithstanding such a logical and legal fallacy, the Court has, by way of opin-
ion, spoken of a Sixth Amendment "correlative right" to dispense with a lawyer's
help. Many lower federal courts have seized upon this and supported their holdi-
ngs on it, in whole or in part.

The basic motivation behind this proffered right of self-representation is that
"respect for individual autonomy requires that (the defendant) be allowed to go
to jail under his own banner if he so desires" and that he should not be forced
to accept counsel in whom he has no confidence. Courts have ruled that neither
due process nor progressive standards of criminal justice require that the defe-
ndant be represented at trial by counsel. The Supreme Court, in its 1975 decisi-
on, held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right
to waive counsel and carry on his own case in propria persona. In raising this
obscure privilege to a constitutional level, the Court stated that, so long as
the defendant is made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representa-
tion, his lack of technical legal knowledge will not deprive him of the right to
defend himself personally.

The Court conceded that the long line of right to counsel cases have alluded to
the idea that the assistance of counsel is a prerequisite to the realization of
a fair trial. However, the Court noted that the presence of counsel is of minor
significance when a stubborn, self-reliant defendant prohibits the lawyer from
employing his knowledge and skills. This line of reasoning is concluded with the
ovservation that "the defendant and not his lawyer or the state, will bear the
personal consequences of a conviction." The logical extension of this permise b-
rings the Court to its decision that, recognizing the traditional American resp-
ect for the individual, the defendant "must be free personally to decide whether
in his particular case counsel is to his advantage".

                     Property Rights and Freedom of Speech

The Constitution of the United States protects both property rights and freedom
of speech. At times these rights conflict. Resolution then requires a determina-
tion as to the type of property involved. If the property is private and not op-
en to the general public, the owner may absolutely deny the exercise of the rig-
ht of free speech thereon. On the other hand, if public land is at issue, the F-
irst Amendment protections of expression are applicable. However, the exercise
of free speech thereon is not absolute. Rather it is necessary to determine the
appropriateness of the forum. This requires that consideration be given to a nu-
mber of factors including: character and normal use of the property, hte extent
to which it is open to the public, and the number and types of persons who freq-
uent it. If the forum is clearly public or clearly private, the resolution of t-
he greater of rights is relatively straightforward.

In the area of quasi-public property, balancing these rights has produced a dil-
emma. This is the situation when a private owner permits the general public to
use his property. When persons seek to use the land for passing out handbills or
picketing, how is a conflict between property rights and freedom of expression
resolved?

The precept that a private property owner surrenders his rights in proportion to
the extent to which he opens up his property to the public is not new. In 1965,
Lord Chief Justice Hale wrote that when private property is "affected wiht a pu-
blic interest, it ceases to be private". Throughout the development of Anglo-Am-
erican law, the individual has never possessed absolute dominion over property.
Land becomes clothed with a public interest when the owner devotes his property
to a use in which the public has an interest. In support of this position the c-
hairman of the board of the Wilde Lake Shopping Center in Columbia, Maryland sa-
id: The only real purpose and justification of any of these centers is to serve
the people in the area - not the merchants, not the architects, not the develop-
ers. The success or failure of a regional shopping center will be measured by w-
hat it does for the people it seeks to serve.

These doctrines should be applied when accommodation must be made between a sho-
pping center owner's private property rights and the public's right to free exp-
ression. It is hoped that when the Court is asked to balance these conflicting
rights it will keep in mind what Justice Black said in 1945: "When we balance t-
he Constitutional rights of owners of property against those of the people to e-
njoy (First Amendment) freedom(s) ... we remain mindful of the fact that the la-
tter occupy a preferred position."

                              "Felony-Murder" Rule

Under very early common law, all felonies were punishable by death. The perpetr-
ators of the felony were hanged whether or not a homicide had been committed du-
ring the felony. Later, however, most felonies were declared to be noncapital o-
ffenses. The common law courts, in need of a deterrent to the use of deadly for-
ce in the course of these noncapital felonies, developed the "felony-murder" ru-
le. The first formal statement of the rule stated: "Any killing by one in the c-
ommission of a felony is guilty of murder." The killing was a murder whether in-
tentional or unintentional, accidental or mistaken. The usual requirement of ma-
lice was eliminated and the only criminal intent necessary was the intent to co-
mmit the particular underlying felony. All participants in the felony were guil-
ty of murder - actual killer and nonkiller confederates.

Proponents of the rule argued that it was justified because the felon demonstra-
ted a lack of concern for human life by the commision of a violent and dangerous
felony and that the crime was murder either because of a conclusive presumption
of malice or simply by force fo statutory definition.

Opponents of the rule describe it as a highly artificial concept and "an enigma
wrapped in a riddle". They are quick to point out that the rule has been abando-
ned in England where it originated, abolished in India, severely restricted in
Canada and a number of other commonweath countries, is unknown in continental E-
urope, and abandoned in Michigan. In reality, the real strength of the opponent-
s' criticism stems from the bizarre and oft times unfair results achieved when
the felony-murder rule is applied mechanically. Defendants have been convicted
under the rule where the killing was purely accidental, or the killing took pla-
ce after the felony during the later flight from the scene; or a third party ki-
lled another (police officer killed a citizen or vice versa; or a victim died of
a heart attack 15-20 minutes after the robbery was over; or the person killed w-
as an accomplice in the felony).

Attacks on the rule have come from all directions with basically the same demand
- reevaluate and abandon the archaic legal fiction; restrict and limit vicarious
criminal liability; prosecute killers for murder, not nonkillers; increase puni-
shment for the underlying felony as a real detrrent; and initiate legislative m-
odifications. With the unstable history of the felony-murder rule, including its
abandonment by many jurisdictions in this country, the felony-murder rule is dy-
ing a slow but certain death.

                            Supreme Court of the US

In many ways, the Supreme Court is the worst place to win a human rights case -
even when an Earl Warren is sitting as Chief Justice. It takes a large amount of
money and a long time to get a case to the Court. Even when a party wins, he may
not come out with a clear victory. The decisions are seldom unanimous, and a fi-
ve-to-four or six-to-three split tends to weaken the impact of a majority opini-
on. A Supreme Court decision may have a tremendous effect in the long run, but
it seldom brings about immediate major changes.

Most cases do not get to the Supreme Court anyway. This is especially true of h-
uman rights disputes, where the parties usually cannot afford to appeal, and th-
eir lawyers will never get paid even if they win because a monetary award seldom
goes with a victory on principle. Most disputes never even become lawsuits. Peo-
ple don't tend to go to a lawyer when they think they have been treated unfairl-
y. They may not know a lawyer they trust; they may not have the money to pay a
fee; and they don't think it will help to go to court anyway. This means that f-
or most people the highest court, the supreme court of the land, is the policem-
an on the beat, the highway patrolman, the parent, the priest, the landlord, the
boss, the creditor, or the voter registrar. A decision by the Supreme Court gua-
ranteeing human rights has no meaning until these people around the country know
about and decide to follow it.

Of course, all the courts and government agencies in the coutry are required to
follow Supreme Court decisions, too. But "the Court's authority - possessed of
neither the purse nor the sword - ultimately rests on sustained public confiden-
ce in its moral sanction", as Justice Frankfurter put it so succinctly. And com-
pliance with Warren Court opinions was certainly not automatic.

Studying the development of human rights law through the landmark decisions of
the Warren Court can lead to increased respect for our legal system. At the same
time it can lead to the opposite conclusion: that the best time to win a human
rights case is at the beginning, the best place is where the case starts, the b-
est judge and jury are the participants, and the best method is without a lawsu-
it. In other words, the best protectors of human rights are not the courts but
rather citizens who know and insist on their own rights and who act to guarantee
the rights of others to freedom, justice, and equality.

Citizens concerned about human rights who were raised during the Warren Court e-
ra came to depend on the Court to right the wrongs created by acts of Congress,
executive orders, and lower court decisions, and by the actions of government o-
fficials, private citizens, and groups. The Corut did not always fulfill this f-
unction, but it did so more often than any previous Supreme Court - and perhaps
more often than any Court of the near future. To the extent it followed and adv-
anced the development of human rights law, it was the Camelot of courts rather
than on their own collective action. To the extent it disarmed the people by su-
ggesting reliance on the courts rather than on their own collective action, it
led to disillusionment when Earl Warren stepped down. It is necesary to reassess
the opportunities for progress through the judicial system.
